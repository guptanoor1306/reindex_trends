No report showed gearboxes leaked oil, kickstarts caused leg injuries, and the cast iron engine made the bike 20 kg heavier.

The sun rises in Mumbai at around 6:00 a.m. But in Gujhati, it's at 4:30 a.m. So by the time offices and schools open, peak daylight hours are already gone in the east.

682da3beb723029f5eea7cc7,3 Star AC vs 5 Star AC- Which one should you get?⚡️,#shorts #savings #strategy,"A cheaper AC but higher electricity bill or an expensive AC and lower electricity bill. They say five-star AC saves 25% on your electricity bill, but that's only half the truth. The reality, it only consumes 25% less energy than a threestar AC. But that doesn't always translate to lower bills. In Delhi, a fivestar AC saves this much. Meaning you recover the extra cost in 3 years, 9 months. In Bangalore, it's 830 rupees per year, 11 plus years to break even. Not worth it. In Mumbai, with higher electricity rates, it's not that good. But here's the twist. A study found that during peak summer temperatures above 40° C, a five-star AC can consume 10 to 28% more power than its declared efficiency. So, three star or fivestar, the truth is it depends.

Since Trump went nuts with the Chinese tariffs, China is retaliating using Tik Tok. They're making videos telling the world how their favorite luxury products are made in their factories for less than half the price. For example, Burkin, which claims to be made in Tuscanyany, may actually have more ties to Chinese factories. And this has shocked consumers. China claims that they can sell you the exact same thing without the logo. But here's where things get interesting. Cheap knockoffs have long been a specialty of China. It controls 86% of the world's fakes and knockoffs. So the real question is, is China exposing a truth the luxury world doesn't want you to know? Or is this just a clever way to undermine Western brands with highquality knockoffs?",https://youtube.com/watch?v=682da3beb723029f5eea7cb8,2025-04-19T15:30:27,short

68a92f1553970041576efe17,Best Strategy for Short Term Investing,"We all have short-term goals - maybe it’s a new phone, a vacation, or just saving up for something that makes life a little better. But when it comes to money, most advice is about the “long term.” What about the next 1 - 3 years?

In this video, I’ll walk you through simple short-term options like savings accounts, fixed deposits, debt funds, and more - explaining how they actually work, what risks they carry, and how to choose wisely. It’s not just about money, though - it’s about habits, priorities, and knowing when you’ve reached enough.

PS: In the short-term investing calculator shown in the video, some values (like the monthly funding gap) are approximated. We request check the Excel calculator for exact calculations.

Here is your short term master calculator: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UzZ_TpW1HAchzI54k7c-4sn2ofzegluFeaA3oEB-Iw8/edit?gid=371916766#gid=371916766","I know you're tired of listening to people saying, ""Invest in the market for the next 20 years and then all your dreams will come true."" So, I tried to fulfill the dreams of 50 people in the office. Listen up, guys. We put a board over here. I want you to put all of your short-term goals, you know, your wishes over there. With the boys, I want a car. So, we're going to use this to figure out two things. One, what are all the options available for you to actually invest in a shorter term? And second, I'll actually give you a calculator so you can figure out what works for you. Let's look at the first one, which is a savings account. It's basically a bank account offering some kind of savings rate. You have normal bank accounts giving you some savings rate. You have some lesser known banks giving you a higher savings rate. So, you have savings account as an option. This is between 3 1/2% all the way to 7% depending on what bank you actually inquire and the risk is relatively lower and the best here is savings deposits are liquid. You ask for money and the bank gives it back. No lock in taxation is the most important but I'll tell you in the end. So let's see savings account may you can maybe do finish a book because uh this doesn't require any money it requires time because you're working overtime. This is savings account. Of course, you can do a lot more with a savings account. I'd love to hear what you've done. But let's move on to the next option. Basically, investing in low duration bonds. Uh, a lot of companies borrow money from the public and institutions for operations for a very short period of time. That's 0 to 90 days. Now, the returns you can see over here 6 to 7%, what you have to figure out is what kind of instrument makes sense for you versus just the returns which is not too much in your control. These funds carry very low risk because their NAV does not move too much like equities. For liquidity, this takes between two to three days for your money to come back. So if you exit on a Monday, that's transaction day plus one that's Tuesday. Tuesday evening you will receive the money or t + 2 would mean weddness evening you'll receive the money. So that's something you should know that it's not immediately available like a savings account. So, let's see if we can find something on the board to actually solve. And I guess um the iPad is possible, the Sure Mic is possible, but I'll pick the Eyewatch. As we move ahead of this and we keep going up the ladder of the different options, we will be able to remove more stuff out because time is where wealth is built, right? So, if you give a little more time, then you're able to actually make those goals a lot. Remember, if you want to make your life tough, make the goals big and make the goals short-term. It'll mess up your life. Don't do that, kids. Don't do that. Let's see the next option. Then we have the favorite instrument for all Indians, fixed deposit and recurring deposit. I'll do this together. Basically, very simple. It's a bank deposit with money locked in. Uh, a recurring deposit is the same thing, but it happens every single month. So, it builds the habit of savings. I think it's an absolutely amazing product because not only does everyone have a bank account, but they can actually create a recurring deposit or a deposit in their mobile app and start immediately. Money is not actually built in choosing the right product and waiting for a long time. Money is built in the micro habits that is created when you do small decisions every day. So once you start building the right habits, the smallest decision today to even start a,000 rupee fixed deposit or a recurring deposit changes you 10 years from now. And we can see here that the returns are between 6 to 7%. But frankly for senior citizens slightly different for the 10ear it's different. So please check with your bank. Uh the risk is considered very low but remember the risk is never zero. I've heard people say fixed deposit carries no risk. Not true. There is an insurance on top of your fixed deposit, but there is risk. The bank can go bankrupt. It can run out and you can lose your FD. No investment is zero risk. There is some risk in everything. Fixed deposits do not beat inflation. Not true. This is overly simplistic. In 2013, we have all the way to 2024, we have fixed deposit rates and we have inflation rates. And on the right we have the real return. Every single year was a positive percentage increase in terms of returns except 3 years - 2% minus.1% and minus.3%. So first we can do the shite and I think it's 50,000 I'm guessing. Usibad we have Ladak trip. Yeah this is also possible in something like a fixed deposit. It's basically saving smartly and yeah that's possible. uh cat 99 percentile savings. [Music] Then we come to the arbitrage mutual fund. First let me explain what arbitrage is. Imagine you're buying a packet of paneer from a particular company. Same gramage, same company, same everything and it costs 100 rupees in this shop. But if you walk slightly ahead on the other side of town, the same thing, same product, same company, same quality is 110 rupees. Now imagine if you could buy from this shop and sell it to that shop, you'd make 10 rupees profit. The same commodity is mispriced or has a very big gap in price in two different marketplaces. So in arbitrage, the difference is between spot and futures or between cash and futures. My point is very simple. There is a futures market and the cash market. Though no there is some difference at the end of the month that difference becomes zero and therefore this is an opportunity to earn money. Funds can actually make money by doing an arbitrage strategy. You can see the average returns in the last 1 year for these funds. Remember this keeps changing but if you look historically it gives some okay okay returns over a period of time. Remember it has a T +3 settlement and the risk is low but you know a lot depends over here on volatility. If the market moves a lot the arbitrage funds actually do pretty well. If the market's very stale you know there's no volatility then the arbitrage funds do not make as much money because the difference between the two instruments is not very wide and therefore they don't make a lot of cash because of that. So over here we can use uh you can do trip with family pro camera. Okay. Ka kagas man iPhone pro. Yeah this is quite easily done. International trip with boys. H I wonder who did this. Who is the one person in office who wants all the time? Sir, vacation please sir. Then we have the equity savings mutual fund. So about 65% is invested in equity. That's the growth portion and the rest is invested in the fixed portion giving you stabilized returns, stable returns. Uh the interesting thing over here is your horizon increases from something like a few years to 3 to 5 years because you are now looking at something that has a large equity portion of it. So any of these things like uh I want to buy a car gets into this because now the wait time is slightly longer. Uh there's another car here. What else? Anything else? Can you point something? Porn trip. Yeah, you can add that as well. But you get my point. Now over here, what we've done, this is not a a fast rule. Like these things can interchange, right? A lot of this thing can be done in a fixed deposit as well. Our idea was to basically pull this out from actual people's short-term wishes and turn them into what they possibly could be. Travel plus D. Travel plus diesel are LV Air Jordans. I don't know how much this is for, so I'll leave it here. [Music] So now let's move on to the next option. That's the conservative hybrid mutual fund. But before I do that, I want to talk about this. By this time, you've thought about everything you want. Hopefully you've posted something in the comments. If you've not, please hit the send button right now. I need you to think. Every time you add something to your list, you take away something from this list. There is nothing wrong in wanting stuff. It's fine. You're earning it. You're working hard. But remember, it comes at a cost that's more than just money. So, I'm going to put this somewhere important. I'll put it right next to my laptop so it reminds you that peace of mind is more important than anything else. Anyway, a hybrid fund has 10 to 25% in equity and the rest is in bonds. So, it's way more stable because it's diversified into fixed income more. So, it's relatively lesser riskier than your equity mutual savings fund. Uh returns of course vary. It could be anywhere between 9% to 11%. The settlement is T+1 or T +2. And now let's talk about taxation. The most important part. We created this table right here. But I wasn't sure if it's right or wrong. So I asked my friend Vishma Pratik. This is spot on. Anyhow, short-term investments are taxed at higher rates and investors must know about this. Now that we know all the options, this sheet will give you clarity. It takes your goal, shows what you already have, what you're saving, and the gap you still need to cover. and at the end helps you decide whether do you save more, extend the timeline or change the goal itself. So I'll pick something which is very tough, something that you need a calculator for. [Music] I wanted to pick Yeah, this one. Sorry. The vacation to Paris. Now a trip to Europe is not cheap and you have to make sure that you can actually calculate it. So let's calculate it. I'm going to put it here. Let's put a target date for this. I'll put 2026 December. So it's 1 year and something few months. Amount needed is let's say 22 lakh rupees. Inflation is 6%. Current corpus my what I have for this trip is 50,000 and current monthly investment is 5,000. You can change this. Um, now here is when the art of investing or the art of choosing happens. We have priority. Priority means how important is this to you? One means this is very important. It's as important as and five means it's not that important. Maybe I should it's okay if I don't do it for some time. It's doesn't matter that much. Now, here is where the automatic calculation happens. You'll see here it says 90day to 3ear. If I scroll all the way to the right, I can see what instrument I have for 90day to three years, which is liquid funds, low duration, debt funds. Now remember, this is not a recommendation. It's a calculator that you can use to make your choices easier. If this doesn't make sense, you can obviously change the choices. But let's see what we've got so far. I have an inflation adjusted amount. I have an expected return. So if you think the expected return here is wrong, you can reduce it. Then you have the required monthly amount to invest. Over here it's 9,000. Now I know we were investing 5,000 there is a funding gap of 4,164 that means extra to actually meet this expectation. The tweak can also be you can increase the risk to an higher riskier product and hope that it works. This is never recommended. Ideally you should do the others that is increase the amount or decrease the budget. This also will tell you tweak time. Can I extend this goal by another 6 months to actually hit this? So you'll know. Or it just says by rework the budget, add a lump sum or add some more money and then you'll be able to do it. Also, this is not a perfect calculator. So for every situation, it will not give you the absolute rightest answer. Writest but maybe you don't have the best answer. The problem with Excel sheets although is this that an Excel sheet expects you to add more goals and when you add more goals you want to continue to add more goals and that creates a problem in a different Excel sheet your emotional Excel sheet of peace of mind. The peace of mind thing actually doesn't work because you always want something more and once you've got it Instagram will show you something even better and you'll feel this loss of experience. What if your life becomes an endless list of risks and lists that never ends? So you have to now make a new list, the it is enough list. And once you create this enough list, then you will start feeling life a little better and feeling happy about it. Otherwise, you're always in a race. Your actual list, your actual task is to end that race. And once it's done and you're out of the race, that's the actual time when you have won. Think about it.

Let's check. While gold jewelry from Dubai looks more yellowish, Indian gold often has a slightly copper reddish tone. That's because when gold is made into jewelry, it is not 100% pure gold. To make it sturdy and durable, an alloy is added to the gold. So, in 22 karat gold, out of 1,000 g, 916 g is pure gold and the remaining 84 g is an alloy. Now the composition of this alloy decides the color of the jewelry. If the alloy contains a high percentage of silver or zinc, the gold appears more yellow.

Located just 10 minutes away from Andhiri station, Gilbert Hill was formed around 65 million years ago. It was created due to volcanic activity during which Vasal rocks fell at three different places on Earth. Out of these, two rocks formed similar hills in the United States while one fell in India. Now, a hill this rare would obviously be very well preserved. However, the 225 ft tall Gilbert Hill, which until 60 to 70 years ago was surrounded by vegetation, today stands trapped between multi-story buildings and slums.

EVs cost just 1.5 rupees per kmter versus 8 rupees for petrol and maintenance is comparatively cheaper. Sounds great, right? But here's the hidden cost. Battery replacement is 3 to 4.5 lak rupees. And in some EVs, even 7 to 12 lak rupees. And depreciation. EVs generally depreciate more than fuel cars. Meanwhile, fuel cars hold value better because they have proven long-term reliability. Speaking of charging, fast charges degrade batteries faster and home charging takes 8 plus hours. Not to mention, India still has limited charging infrastructure compared to fuel stations. So, EV or fuel, both have pros and cons. If you drive a lot and have access to home charging, an EV might make sense, but if you want long-term reliability and resale value, a fuel car still holds strong.

6913f8a132179b5ffb1e1daa,Get a PROPERTY for FREE,"🚨 No EMI till possession 🚨 - this promise sounds too good to be true, isn't it? 

And for thousands of homebuyers, this promise to them turned into a nightmare.

Here’s what might happen in these subvention schemes: You book an under-construction flat, take a home loan, and the builder promises to pay your EMIs till the flat is ready. So you think, “Perfect! I’ll just pay 10-20% now and won’t have to worry about EMIs for a while.”

But the problem starts when the builder delays the project or stops paying EMIs. Since the loan is in your name, the bank comes after you. Your credit score takes a hit. And you are stuck paying both rent and EMI. And worst of all, the flat is still half built and is far from completion. 

This trick became popular after 2010 and was used heavily till 2019. Even though RBI and NHB warned banks, and RERA rules said money should be released to builders only as construction progresses, many builders still found ways around it - especially in smaller cities.

Recently, the Supreme Court said RERA should not be a “toothless tiger” and that homebuyers deserve stronger protection.

In a nutshell, if someone offers you a deal that sounds too easy - think twice :) 

Ask questions. Check if the loan is linked to construction progress. And remember, in finance, there’s no such thing as a free lunch.

Basically, you get a home and the builder pays your EMIs until your house is ready. This could be a scam because after the 2008 subprime crash, banks stopped lending to builders. So, builders started asking home buyers to take the loan instead, and the builder promises to pay the EMIs until the home is ready. But many builders ran out of money, stopped paying EMIs and delayed projects, and the bank came after you because the loan was in your name. So if a builder ever says no EMI till possession, ask yourself why is he asking you to take the loan?",https://youtube.com/watch?v=6913f8a132179b5ffb1e1daa,2025-11-11T12:30:51,short
68dc999c066abb9793c591f9,iphone 16 vs 17 - Price Drop,"Price skimming is a strategic pricing model where a company launches a new, innovative product at the highest possible price and then systematically lowers it over time.

The primary goal is to maximize revenue by ""skimming"" the top layer of the market first. This initial high price targets early adopters and loyal fans who have a high willingness to pay for the latest product and are not sensitive to price. This phase creates a sense of exclusivity and helps the company quickly recover its research and development costs.

Once the demand from this initial group is met, the company strategically lowers the price in stages. Each price drop appeals to a new, more price-sensitive segment of the market, like those who wait for deals or reviews.

This tactic is most effective for products with strong brand equity and a significant competitive advantage, such as new iPhones, gaming consoles, etc. By selling the same product to different customer groups at different times and prices, a company can maximize its total profit far more effectively than with a single launch price.","Wait, why is Apple selling its 80,000 rupee iPhone 16 for just 56,999? Now, see, when a new model launches, Apple targets only the diehard fans and early adopters because this group will pay any premium to have the latest tech first. But when this hype ends and a new model launches, they reduce the prices of older models to maximize their sales. This is called price skimming and it's done by hundreds of brands.",https://youtube.com/watch?v=68dc999c066abb9793c591f9,2025-09-30T13:00:04,short

Silver seems to be on a winning streak in 2025. The World Silver Survey 2025 highlights a massive 208 million ounce shortfall, showing that demand is far outpacing supply - a classic recipe for rising prices.

With supply tightening globally and policy tailwinds at home, silver is fast turning into one of the most rewarding assets this year.

68ef0ea4271500ad9d132d87,Is Silver the BEST investment of 2025?,"Silver prices have been rising, and one of the key reasons is its increasing demand in industries like electronics, semiconductors, and especially electric vehicles (EVs). Silver is used twice as much in EVs compared to traditional ICE vehicles, with around 25-50 grams of silver in each EV. As EV demand grows, silver demand follows suit. 

Additionally, silver’s role in clean energy is growing, with its use in the solar industry rising from 4% in 2016 to 17% in 2024. As industries shift towards sustainability, silver’s demand is expected to keep climbing.

Some countries manage with low or no income tax, often relying on natural resources or very high consumption taxes. For example, UAE charges 0% income tax to its citizens.

68edbd2fba9af94d4fb27c67,Is SILVER the NEW GOLD? 🤔,"We have more about currency effect for you below: 

Gold: In USD, gold has returned an average of 7.6% per year over the past three decades. But if you also consider the dollar’s depreciation, the return for investors in countries like India is closer to 11%. So, while gold has gone up in price, the weaker dollar has made it even more valuable in local currencies.

Silver: Silver has returned 6.4% annually in USD. But after considering currency depreciation, the return jumps to 9.8%.

What this means is that, for investors in countries with weaker currencies, the returns on gold and silver have been better than what the USD numbers show. The combination of rising metal prices and a depreciating dollar has made these investments more attractive in some regions.

In simple terms, when gold goes up, silver tends to follow. So, buying both metals together in large quantities might not help you diversify much, as they move in similar directions. If you're aiming for diversification, it’s better to look for assets that behave differently.

Sounds crazy - but it’s true. In this video, we break down how China’s massive Three Gorges Dam may have actually affected the Earth’s rotation.

From shifting mass to scientific facts confirmed by NASA, this is one of the wildest ways human activity has impacted the planet - and most people have no idea.

👉 What caused it?
👉 How much did Earth slow down?
👉 Should we be worried?

#China #EarthRotation #ThreeGorgesDam #NASA #GeoEngineering #Zero1 #MindBlown","China slowed down the earth's rotation. The three gorgeous dam built on the Yangzi river is the biggest dam in the world. It's 600 ft tall and 7,600 ft long and behind it 39 lakh cr L of water. That's enough to supply the entire Delhi for 2 years and 3 months. But why did this slow the earth down? It's due to a physics concept called moment of inertia. When a person spreads his arms, he spins slower because his weight moves away from his core. China did the same to the Earth by lifting trillions of liters of water upward. They pushed the planet's mass away from its core and that slowed Earth's rotation by 0.06 06 microsconds.",https://youtube.com/watch?v=688596af2b5a8df9bfc8969c,2025-07-26T12:30:37,short

What am I really paying for? A 1% expense fee may seem small, but over time it eats into returns. That's why I skip regular plans. They include hidden commissions I didn't notice earlier.

South pole sabse pehle, seedhe baithe jaake chand par
Karke market break, sedha satve aasman par

Sarkar ne badhaya GST ka Tax,
..agayi Betting apps ki jaan par

Moonlight karte log sote sunlight mein
Swiss bank ki bhi fati hogaya woh side mein
UBS ne kar liya acquire
Black money waale shaant baithe saale iss ride mein

HDFC merge karke bana bada bank
Motabhai kaise peeche rehte, aagaye leke tank
Jio finance kya kare game change?
Kai logo hain rumour, ki yeh kar rahe prank?


Launde startup karke ban rahe CEO
Fir tata bhi le aaya naya IPO
Mujhe pata thoda heavy hogaya hoga saalo,
Hook aane waala hain tum chill karo chai peeyo

This is FY 24
India rukne nahi waala, yaha macha shor
Hum moon pe ja baithe, don't knock the door
Hum paise hain banare and we want some more

Finfluencer kara ban, galat jo sikhata hain
Crore ka loss kyu startup mein dikhata hain?
Bollywood ke sitaare utaare zameen par
Isse jyada ambani pre wedding pe lagata hain

Twiiter ko banaya elon ne X
G20 India ne hit kara flex
India ki population baithi ab top pe
Bas karo bhaiyo kitna karoge tum fecks

Nifty ki growth yaha rukhna nahi mangti
Nvidia ka game plan le aaya kranti
Bhaiyo 2 min waala maun rakhenge,
Munger ki aatma ko mil jaye jo shanti

68f1b19e243f353791ca0f27,DARK days of Indian Economy (1991),"In 1991, India faced a severe economic crisis, with foreign exchange reserves dwindling to just $1.2 billion - barely enough to cover three weeks of imports. To avert a default, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) pledged 67 tonnes of gold as collateral for emergency loans. This included airlifting 47 tonnes to the Bank of England and 20 tonnes to the Union Bank of Switzerland (UBS). 

This drastic measure led to significant economic reforms, including the devaluation of the rupee, trade policy changes, and the initiation of liberalization under Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao and Finance Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh. By November 1991, the gold was repurchased, and the country's economic trajectory shifted toward growth and modernization. In 2024, India repatriated nearly 100 tonnes of gold from the UK, marking a full circle in its economic journey.

68d75394de7ac561ce1ee49c,GOLD v/s SILVER - Who will give MORE RETURNS? 🤔,"Gold vs Silver: which is better in 2025? 

If you had put ₹1 lakh into silver back in 2005, today it would be worth around ₹9 lakhs. But the same money in gold would’ve grown to almost ₹15 lakhs. And when you look at the last 50 years, silver has actually underperformed gold nearly 80% of the time.

The main reason is how the two metals are used. Gold is mostly seen as a safe store of value, something people turn to during inflation or crises. Silver, on the other hand, has a big role in industries - like solar panels, electronics, EVs, even medical devices. That means silver’s price moves up and down much more with economic cycles, making it more unpredictable.

In short, gold usually offers steadiness, while silver comes with higher swings—sometimes rewarding, sometimes risky.

If you make the batter in a factory, it would spoil on its way to another city. But IDFresh had a genius idea to solve this problem. A zero inventory model. They would prepare and pack the batter before it fully fermented. So, the batter would finish fermenting on its journey to the store inside the delivery truck, arriving at the store perfectly",https://youtube.com/watch?v=6882f3bb2b5a8df9bfc7f9d7,2025-07-24T07:00:31,short

Many people believe that Fixed Deposits never beat inflation. But that’s not always true. Looking at the numbers from 2013 to 2024, a clear story emerges: FD rates and inflation rates show that out of 12 years, FDs delivered positive real returns in 9 years. Only in 2013, 2020, and 2021 did the returns slip into negative territory.

So, what does this mean for you? Simply put, the real return is the FD rate minus inflation. For example, if your FD earns 7% but inflation is 5%, your money actually grows by 2% in real terms.

When we paying a credit card bill, we think if we pay the minimum payment, we've made some payment. But no, you're supposed to make the full 30,000 payment, which means you owe 30,000 to the credit card company. Cool. Done. >> All right. >> Let's assume we pay just the minimum payment every single month for 12 months. Did you know this 3 12% interest rate is actually 42% yearly interest rate? And then over the 12 months you'll actually pay roughly 16,600 and your actual 30,000 will only reduce by 5,000. That 30k becomes 25K and the rest I think 11,000 something went all to",https://youtube.com/watch?v=688839be2b5a8df9bfc923da,2025-07-28T12:30:50,short

68d35f0e5f5a4bb152cf0003,Dark REALITY of Indian's Road accidents,"#roadsafety #shorts #accident 

Indian roads are among the deadliest in the world and the data doesn’t even tell the full story. Nearly 1.7 lakh people died in road accidents in 2022, but according to WHO and independent studies, India may be underreporting deaths by up to 40%.

And that's a serious problem: when a crash happens, the first step is filing an FIR. In more than 80% of cases, the cause is recorded as “human error”. Bad road design, faulty vehicles, or poor infrastructure rarely make it to the report. By the time this data reaches the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the real causes vanish.

This is why the Indian Status Report on Road Safety 2024 calls for better data and crash surveillance systems. Countries like Sweden, the US, and Australia have already implemented such systems and seen dramatic improvements in road safety. Meanwhile, India even received $500 million from the World Bank and ADB to improve its road safety framework - but progress has been slow.

682da3beb723029f5eea7ca6,The Secret Behind Mutual Fund Investing! 📈,#shorts #trending #money #investing #mutualfunds,"Good batsman isn't judged by one century. It's about consistent performance. Well, mutual funds are not any different. What really matters are rolling returns. For example, you're trying to compare the mutual funds 3-year returns over a 10-year period. Instead of just looking at returns from 2015 to 2017 or 2017 to 2019, you would calculate the 3-year return across every possible period, not just one. That means for every single day, week or month starting in 2015 and ending in 2025. If the fund consistently delivers strong three-year rolling returns across most time periods, it's a sign of stable and reliable performance even across volatile markets. That's like a batsman scoring runs in all conditions, all formats. The Varat Kohli of mutual funds.",https://youtube.com/watch?v=682da3beb723029f5eea7ca6,2025-05-06T15:00:51,short
