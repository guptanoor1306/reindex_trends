    "transcript_full": "so Sadat uh what is your salary expectation well I think I'm an MBA with four to five years of experience I expect something around 6 to 65 LPA uh that's a bit too steep I don't think we'll be able to 65 lakhs done sir thank you sir stay happy sign in sign sign it congratulations thank you sir thank you ma'am sir I need to talk to you regarding something sir H tell me sir interview 65 lakh ccci which means 5.41 lakhs in hand sir I got only 1.36 lak sir beta you don't know how all of these things work this means you also don't know how CTC and inhand works don't disturb me with this go and talk to HR wait wait a minute talk to HR no you need to understand how this works how CTC and inhand works because when you see those newspapers and colleges and all these people saying you don't need to feel that for more you need to understand how this calculation actually works so in this episode of De influencing we thought we'll de influence salary packages and I'm talking about those large goodlooking juicy ones because the form over here shouldn't happen you should just understand how it works we'll talk about the good we'll talk about the bad cuz certainly these guys won't so let's [Music] begin so there's nothing wrong with the big fact CTC the problem is your expectation what happens is once you see this you divide the CTC by 12 take out a monthly number and tell everyone now everyone's celebrating but what you've done is youve set expectations for society your friends people and yourself and if something happens that changes that reality it causes unhappiness so enough with philosophy let's start to decode this entire package so check these two offers out look nice don't they so this one over here is 1.7 crores but notice that it's actually an international offer purchasing power of every country is different we also call this living costs for example if you look at say Alo or potatoes in India it costs this much here and this much abroad you could do the same thing with say a bottle of water the same thing would apply to all other living costs like buying a car taxi traveling etc etc and because of those base costs the living costs increase which is why there's a difference in salary sometimes now this changes two things one you are not noticing that there is a price difference of living costs of living in India and living abroad the living costs mean that the salaries are also slightly different when you hear about such a package the first question you should ask is job abroad is this job abroad or is this job in India now this doesn't mean it's more money it just means that it's more money in Indian rupees but anyway let's come straight to the point let's look at an Indian offer and this is a real offer I've removed the details but this breakdown is actually true and let's understand the difference between the CTC and the inhand and how they can possibly be a really large difference this offer is of 65 lakh rupees you know the one that we gave sadhart and over here we'll break down all these different paths starting from the base salary which is 16 lakh rupees huh 16 lakh rupees I thought the offer was 65 lakhs that's exactly my point this is your fixed base salary just you know you will get this no matter what at the end of the month and 16 lakhs divide by 12 is a lot less than 65 lakhs divided by 12 up you have to pay tax on this obviously so all of this is coming to you but you have to pay income tax obviously but we'll do that in the end now that you've understood the base salary let's move on to the next part and that is called the joining bonus this pretty easy to understand a joining bonus is simply the amount you get when you join the company and this is amazing it's actual real cash there's no problem over here and you can enjoy it there just two small issues one this is a onetime event so it won't happen the year 2 or year three so thinking that entire CTC is yours may not be right because this joining bonus is not a recurring amount it happens once second the joining bonus exists so that you stay in the company some of these companies will have a clause that say if you leave in the next one or 2 years you have to pay back that joining bonus so well you have to stay back so I don't know how you should calculate it but it's a onetime event the next component is esops my favorite esops is 40 lakh RUP is in a 65 lakh CTC that's like 60% of the entire offer so what are esops esops is a way for you to create wealth it gives you the option to buy shares in the company you're working at so if you're working for a Google and Google takes off you also earn the equity growth of that company and this is fantastic it's actually a great way a lot of people have become rich by becoming just ESOP holders and growth in the equity but the understanding is the problem this 40 lakhs doesn't come in the first year usually there is a vesting period now let's suppose a vesting period is 4 years vesting period simply means you have to work to earn the right to own these esops these options so a 4-year wait and you actually get the amount in the fifth year is a longer duration it shouldn't be included in your package because you're not getting it in the first year also if the company goes to zero the value of the e top is zero it's Equity we go up together go down together a private company the only way that you can actually cash in or turn your esops which is a piece of paper into money is if the company buys back your esops themselves or the company has a liquidation event like it goes IPO it gets bought out an investor wants to enter and buy shares from you etc etc in only that case will you actually convert this paper into Cash oh of course like every other thing when you earn from an ESOP you have to pay the tax too then we have the retention bonus which is simply a reason for you to stay so in this case it's 1 lakh rupees and if you stay for that year you get to keep it but if you leave then you have to pay that 1 lakh back now this could be offered in the second or third year completely at the discretion of the company but let me assume for this case it may be non-recording okay the next component is performance bonus I love this because people who work in our office are given kras kras and kpis if they don't meet the standard of the company which is pretty high you basically won't get that bonus and we have this crazy way of calculating it and HR gives them the incentive we call it here if they performed well so well I guess the problem while looking at this when getting an offer is if you do well you get the payout otherwise you don't then we have relocation bonus which is pretty simple if you're moving from one city to another there's a onetime payment for you to move this is fine you may or may not have it if you're work from home it does not apply if you're not moving cities again it does not apply in many cases people don't even do a relocation bonus but we included it because hey we're making a video we have to include everything that's included now you know and before moving to the inhand calculation of the salary I have one more component to talk about and that is other allowances this could include stuff like books I can see educational courses food traveling Etc if you don't do any of this and don't take the reimbursement you don't get the benefit or if the meal coupons you get for the food just don't work in a restaurant you want you can't benefit out of it but remember these are other perks you get with that job and usually upon joining you don't know how to actually claim them but it's a nice little thing to join a nice little company company with some good bucks so as you can see all of the components are either one time or they happen at a future date after a few years so what we need to do is find out out of this big CTC we have what's our final in hand so if I take 65 lakhs divided by 12 it's 5.4 lakhs a month but what's the actual inhand let's see so if I take the 16 lakhs and add the 5 lakh bonus the per month in hand after taxes is 1.36 lakhs and then you have esops so let's assume there's a 4-year vesting and it's 40 lakhs so you'll get 10 lakhs every year vested remember vested that is eligible for a sale but not just vested you need the company to actually do a buyback if it's a private company and you need to get it allocated and sell it in the open market if it's a public company so I won't include it over here but now you know now let's calculate the second year salary now common sense says that every year you should get some bump in the base salary so let's assume it's a 10% increase and let's say you also got a performance bonus I've also added over here A 1 lakh retention bonus uh so there won't be any joining bonus um we are looking at after all these calculations it's 1.25 lakhs and of course remember if you leave the job in a year that retention bonus 1 lakh you have to give back cool now that we understand this I think there is just one question let's look at what happens in the industry starting with colleges we can see this headline says average salary of the college was 28.8 lakhs now that feels amazing and now we know that the average salary was calculated with a bunch of stuff that is non- recing and the inhand is different but there's one more aspect to it it's how the average is calculated and I have an actual table over here to show you in this example we have 40 students who got 5 lakh rupees we have 25 students and 20 students who got 8 lakhs and 15 lakhs respectively 10 students who got 40 lakh rupees and just five students who got 80 lakhs what I want you to notice here is that 40 students Got 5 lakhs five students got 80 lakhs so here's what you have to notice the mode is 5 lakh rupees which is the most number of students would actually offer 5 lakhs it's the most recurring number second the mean is 15 lakh rupees and it's 15 because we have some students who got 80 lakhs offer it them skewed because of that skew they've made this imaginary average number of 15 lakh rupees and this is what you see in the newspapers and you feel damn this average is very high but the average is because of the skew what you have to look at is actually the median which is 8 lakhs this is the the proper balance but not a lot of newspapers or media agencies actually talk about it they talk about that higher number 15 you know why cuz it's juicy but it ain't the truth but the problem here is that a lot of people who don't understand this will calculate an Roi based on the CTC and the college fees and think let me get this MBA the second thing I wanted to talk about are the social implications so over here when a nice Etc is revealed the college looks good cuz it can actually attract more students for a higher fee I'm talking about private colleges the student is happy with this even though he knows the breakup because hey everyone in his family is super proud of him and third the entire industry generally looks good that's why this will never break this chuckra view is self serving every participant is happy with the narrative I hope you found this episode interesting tell us what other episodes we can pick out that we can de influence in the comments below say thank you to the entire production crew it takes a village to make these episodes happen watch all the de influencing series and the psychology series more shows are coming out on 01 say something nice in the comments goodbye see you in the next episode thank you sir thank you ma'am but guys look Founders are amazing people and they really work hard to pay your salaries so send a flying kiss to them they're doing a good job",

    "transcript_full": "sir I'll buy This SUV this is my car this is my car I love this abish what's wrong with you behave yourself what is wrong with me what is wrong with you listen you always wanted to buy a sedan so what happened with this SUV look around you sir SUV SUV SUV SUV I want to buy a SUV that's it final okay but you're willing to talk about it right going from sedan to SUV you know there are two things that are affecting your decision which you have no idea about the first one is social and the second one is financial it will make me look cool 10 minutes 10 minutes we'll talk about for 10 minutes we'll talk about both these things which will help you and you select a car if you're thinking of buying a car let's [Music] begin yes sir tell me what do you want to talk about you always teach me invest k diversify portfol return now I want to buy a car that's it you tell me you tell me what's the point of me buying a car at the age of 60 when I'm budha my friend bought a car 2 days back I want to buy the car right now tell me okay I I understand what you're trying to say you're saying you really want to buy the car and I think you need to calm down and you think and you think I'm going to say don't invest in the car instead invest in a mutual fund or whatever stocks or some asset I'm not going to say that if you have money you should definitely enjoy it you should buy the car you should buy the home if you like but you should make sure that you can actually afford it so we'll just have one conversation understanding why you're buying the car and if it makes sense you should definitely go ahead and buy it and enjoy the car because if you're not enjoying life what's the point of investing all your money and sitting and just not well enjoying your life I agree good point you said you look cool the first thing is bro buying a car is actually still really rare around you people may be buying cars but did you know one in 12 households actually own a car which means buying a car in India is actually rare so you're pretty rich you're getting paid enough so you are buying this car not because you really really need it you're also buying it because there's another effect in motion you know what that is fancy t no no social status basically everyone around you will say d all these guys who have such great jobs they have SUV and now abish R also has SUV he is also yes you got me nice so here are two things you're not thinking of okay one you are actually still in your 20s which means you have at least 50 years of work to do okay second thing you actually are buying this to be seen in the society not but the truth is when you take decisions based on social status you buy something that you can't afford and because of that in your 30s and 40s cuz that's when life really hits you you will not be able to afford those actual Joys but because you you've overs spent in your 20s think about this if you're spending more than half of your salary in emis for a card that you don't really require for respect which is effervescent and will go away after some time is it really it maybe not but I I want to buy it it will make me look cool but I also want to buy it I want to go out with my friends go out with my fair enough no sir I got it basically this is expensive but over you know year on Year I'll get more increment I'll get more growth so at that moment I think I'll a I'll be able to afford that car and it'll become cheaper yes correct this is the definition of success stress what stress stress is an expectation where you have no control over that something will happen in the future and I will be happier and when that thing doesn't happen it causes stress but you will give me an anxiety I may not sir you know what you're always negative do you realize that I a positive person you're always negative okay positive yes tell me so here's what car companies have done because people wanted SUVs because people wanted SUVs because people wanted SUVs and it was very expensive they made compact SUVs or SUVs which are under 4 MX and they were able to make more affordable compact SUV SUV feels uh of course so maybe you should look at those cars sir I want to buy big SUV big SUV big SUV okay okay sunroof okay let's let's let's rationalize it a little bit one checklist do you really have a large family to accommodate in an SUV do you really need a really large SV two people you're one right are you dating anyone you will it's not about me yes you will second does it actually fit your budget you will tell my budget yes is there a formula of course there's a formula everything has a formula and the third thing is have you actually checked its safety ratings does it have airbags is it actually a safe every does it Ser yes I also did my my basic checklist and the fourth most important do you actually have the infrastructure in your city to support it offro you are 5 minutes away from Office you're in wide Delhi roads I mean your commute is going to be what 6 minutes where will you Offroad it Saturday Sunday I have off I have I have a life I will go out okay probably somewhere I don't know on a highway if you say so and the fifth point is do you actually enjoy driving that car there are a lot of cars which just look good from the outside but are not a pleasure to drive so have you taken enough test drives to know I will enjoy driving this car because ultimately you to enjoy driving the car okay sir I'll enjoy driving the car only if it has a sunroof in it sunroof more cool this is classic upsell I'm sure you went for a test drive yeah they gave you the top model and you love the top model and they said sir you look so good driving this car how do you know and you said I agree and you put on your Shades so I think if you can afford that the sunroof you should buy it of course you know how affordability works how let's talk about it so the net income that you get in your hand after tax that's your disposable income now whatever is the cost of owning your car cost emi emi service cost maintenance M service fuel cost put all of that together and get your yearly cost of owning that vehicle okay now that amount should not be more than 15% of your disposable income so right now where are you here I mean in percentage are you at 15% or less 30 40 40% sh maybe 40% 40% is high I can manage he thinks he can manage you think 40% is high I think 15% or low is better I think 40% is bad let them decide and also this 15% 40% is really personal this is for people who've done all their basic personal finance so what I'll do is let me show you with an example ex please so let's say you want to buy a car actually let's start with your annual income so it's 20 lakh rupees and then let's remove the income tax you'll be left with a disposable income of about 17 lakh rupees okay so now let's come to the first section that's the buying cost here we have the onroad price of the car we have your down payment let's suppose it's 20% there's a loan amount there's a tenure and of course you have to pay this in 5 years and let's assume it's a 9% loan now I'll also add registration fees you notice the total buying cost is 2.78 lakhs compared to the onroad price of the car1 18 lakhs this is your first thing think about it people always look at the onroad price and assume that's the expense but after adding all of this well it's actually a little bit more it's 21.7 now let's come to the second section which is the operating cost this one's interesting because we have fuel cost per year and I've multiplied this for the entire year we have insurance premium per year and then we have an estimated lifespan of the car let's say it's 10 years so the operating cost of the life of the car is about 5.46 lakhs now I've removed inflation and all to make this calculation a little easier but let's keep going then we have maintenance cost this is something people forget we have the maintenance cost which includes repair and services we have the estimated lifespan of the car and my total maintenance is going to be about 2 lakhs so now here's the interesting bit total cost over the lifespan of the car is about 29.2 3 lakhs and the annual cost of owning the car is about 2.92 lakhs so now at this point you have a total cost of your actual car and the question you need to ask yourself can I really afford it so this calculator is in the description and after you've entered all the values right here is where you'll find out whether you can afford the car yes or no if you use it tell us in the comments if you enjoyed it and learn something new or not cool Hello according to you I should buy a cycle you'll thank me later rur when later so what I've done is we've put a checklist in the description you check it out download it but going back to what we were talking earlier look dude all these social status things you should definitely do right the only problem is this generation has a lot of opportunity if I think about my parents time and then they had to stick to that job for a long time they used to plan their future based on that one job dude you will compound yourself to everything that you want but if you spend everything now in your 30s and 40s you won't be able to get the things that you work so hard for but what's the point of spending at 40 what I want to have it right now what's the number one reason people's personal finance and all their dreams of wanting to buy stuff doesn't work out expenses because the they didn't manage it has nothing to do with the career appraisal conery they just didn't manage their money properly isn't that sad tell us if these videos actually make sense you know and what do we say next for your appraisal uh don't forget to like And subscribe see you in the next video see you in the next video [Music] YouTube maybe you should look at those cars appraisal no need because you're rich enough

    "title_current": "10 Minute Delivery Apps are fooling YOU! 🤡",
    "transcript_full": "[Music] this chocolate if you had to buy 5 years ago you would have to and now it's just a doorbell and everything you ever wanted is at your doorstep in 10 minutes but the problem isn't the 10-minute delivery the problem is that when you add 50 rupees worth of chocolates in your got you end up spending much more and this isn't new this has been happening in supermarkets for a really long time all of these tricks which used to be in the physical world now happen online on an app and all these psychological tricks to make you spend more are called Dark patterns and I'm not talking about handling fees packaging fees delivery fees I'm talking about really dark sneaky stuff that you have no idea that happens in fact in fact if you look at just this bhab Bala cart actually has not one not two Nine dark patterns that you have no idea make you spend 5x more and I'll even rate each of them on a scale of 1 to 10 on how dark they actually are and the ninth one will blow your mind so in this episode we're going to talk about dark patterns we're going to talk about the good we're going to talk about the bad cuz certainly these apps won't tell you their secret let's start with trick number one which I'm sure happened to you I have 200 rupees of discount coupon nice I think can you guess how much cash back he got he got a grand total of rupes 1 yeah I'm not kidding rupees one on a 200 rup discount coupon you know why because you miss the essential word up to up to means between 0 and 200 the app can decide how much discount to give you similarly you'll also find a discount coupon which is 50% off up to 100 which means if your cart value is 200 you get 100 rupes off but if your cart value is 1,000 you still get only 100 rupes off because up to is the limit and 100 rupes is the limit so it's not really 50% off but I also think a lot of us knew this stock pattern so I'll a rating of 2 out of 10 over here let's move on to trickery number two this is how bchara mudit Sunday morning looks like uh beta order some groceries I have to make dinner okay Mama H sorry I'll add this also this and this order placed I'm sure you didn't notice the dark pattern here so he had to order just Tomatoes but the app said if you order a bunch of other things and your cart crosses 100 rupees the delivery will become free so to make the delivery free naturally he added a few more items but here is the problem even after adding multiple items his cart was actually just 99 rupees it didn't even touch 100 so basically because of that 1 rupe technicality they added a bunch of charges and he ended up overpaying and because this is a frictionless enironment he just quickly paid and he had no idea that he overpaid now delivery apps do a sneaky thing that they don't show you what the breakup is and sometimes you have to click and you'll see all these charges small cart fee surge fee platform fee handling fee GST on the handling fee how and at the end it showed excitingly that I saved money the math is literally not mathing anyways this is called drip pricing and was not invented in India it's happened around the world but I think the Indians feel it a little more because her PESA matters so I'll rate this four on the trickery scale because I know I know what you're typing over here you're typing that you already know this delete it right now delete the ones you see ahead are going to blow your mind next Point our friend mudit actually experienced another dark pattern which you didn't notice and that was this just there just there when he clicked pay do you notice that check he had already loaded money into a wallet and it has 1,000 rupees a wallet is basically you've given 1,000 rupees to that company before buying anything and companies do this really efficiently they'll say add 100 rup to the wallet and we'll add another 100 rupees to it Etc in many cases you can't actually withdraw the cash you have to use it in store and some of these companies even add an expiry date to it which I think is really unfair and definitely a dark pattern and Starbucks is notorious for this they have people adding money to their Starbucks app and they had almost 1,500 crores of customers unused money sitting in their bank account and they're earning interest wow this rates 5 out of 10 on the trickery scale because you can check out anytime you like but you can never leave and talking about not leaving these apps want you to buy something not the groceries their Subscription Service once you buy their Subscription Service you get all these benefits like cheaper delivery etc etc and you become a member and once you buy a subscription here is what happens the subscription is 133 a month free delivery saves me 20 rupees 5% off on fruits 10% on groceries and I order 1100k groceries every month but I'm going to go in December sh subscription T control kushy control you can do this I order 400k fruits 700 Staples every month but 21 days that means I need to order extra stuff 1100 into 21 by 30 no no no fruits backup almonds rice chips raisins biscuits that's enough so that means I need to place five orders worth 1533 to save money I'm a genius so basically these memberships will save you money but you'll have to do a lot of math and be a regular customer for it to actually work in your favor but sometimes it's really confusing and sometimes when you think you're not getting the value you want to exit the membership and this is where things get a little interesting you go down to the app you say I want to cancel and then it starts to convince you tell you that you should not exit it starts shaming you telling you how much money you've already saved are you crazy and then you feel a little bit of guilt and you hit the cancel button and now you're still part of the gym you don't go to because they confirmed shamed you and confirm shaming is quite a thing from gym to apps they make you feel guilty for leaving and it works so I give this sneaky little trick because it makes us feel guilty a seven out of 10 on the trickery meter anyway this next do pattern actually is a 10 on 10 on the trickery meter but it's so crazy I want to save it for the end before that we have this look at this page 450 G for this much money for tomatoes so tell me how much does 1 kg of tomato actually cost here now if you go to your local vendor and say by 427 g tom he'll say what either buy 500 G 250 g or a kilo but the app doesn't do this the app is selling you 450 G you know why to prevent you from actually comparing from your local vendor or any other app because it's tough to convert the metrics and no one will do that math so you can focus on what the app wants you to focus on another dark pattern you'll see here is this progress bar this progress bar tells you that you have not done a good job on the app you my sir are a loser if you don't add a bunch of other things you will not be able to unlock this amazing thing for free and you think I think I want this so let me just add a bunch of more things make this progress bar full so that I can unlock this new character sorry item for free and then you also have 50% off on a 10-minute deal there is literally a counter there which is etching into your anxiety ke there is a deal out there that's finishing and you should tap tap tap and just add it and order it because in 10 minutes the world will end guys it's Anda it's bread it's okay you don't need to have a Target in timer here the interesting thing about all of this UI is not the design and the patterns it's that in search of getting something for free you're actually spending way more and the best way to actually become broke is to spend a lot but people do it so that they actually have more money it's weird Paradox of consumerism and these apps know exactly how to do that to you this sneaky little pattern gets an8 out of 10 because I don't know man it just makes you feel bad when you see it and you just have to do it so eight and the next one is going to be the highest rated we've ever seen and it'll probably make you a little sick too look at this the this guy wanted to order something from a 10-minute delivery app and he posted on Twitter that he was offered free tomatoes and there is no way for him to exit or remove it but he just wanted eggs he didn't want the tomatoes now you might think te he's getting free Tomatoes just take it what if you can't remove it it's fine but just below this thread someone replied that he's a vegetarian ordered vegetarian items and he was forced on his basket a free item which was chicken guys I understand the pattern may make sense for the company to give something off for free but the problem isn't that you're getting something for free and you don't like it the problem is where is the consumer's Choice here in fact if you look at this basket the app has added its own membership without even telling you and there is only a remove button it's not an add button you are making a choice for the customer assuming he would benefit from it but the choice is always the customers this is not about free Tomatoes this is not about adding a free item like chicken to a vegetarian's item list it's about the customer's Choice how can you add a membership thing to someone who may not want it it's so easy to tap tap tap and pay you barely notice these things it's literally like someone reaching into your wallet taking money out and giving you nothing because you did not ask for it so this trickery gets a 10 on 10 on the trickery meter the more a company is trying to push you nudge you into doing something that benefits them more and you less you're slowly moving into a world which is not built for you it's built for Hungry capitalists who want to earn money at any cost and if we don't call this out it becomes an epidemic have you ever noticed any of these things tell us some more stories I'm sure there are more dark patterns out there apart from nine",

last year it doesn't matter I just want a new one why you always overhyped what happened sir it was sale it was in sale it was affordable for me to buy affordable oh that's exactly how they treat people like you perfect so here's the thing right companies marketing teams branding teams product teams spend billions of dollars a year just to influence us to buy stuff we all know this right but what about the other side what are the sellers actually doing what do the buyers really think luxury is actually a bigger play than you really think and this is a luxurious purchase so let's start with brand psychological tricks okay so a brand people create an aspirational brand so you want to buy the product wait one minute why would you want to buy a product uh good features technically sound I'll compare it with other phones as well and it should stand out the best nice did you know that sometimes sometimes the best product doesn't win the product that everyone wants but can't have and a few get access to actually wins this is where branding comes think about Apple right every step of the way when you think of the iPhone here's what happens you open Instagram you see celebrities Dawning this beautiful iPhone important people take a photograph and they say sh on iPhone then you go to the Apple Store I know they're not a lot in India but the ones that are look freaking beautiful and cool and look how nice that place looks you enter it smells great there's so much of space there's a apple G helping you out on what kind of phone to take they're nice accessories then once you buy it you come home there's an unboxing experience by phone sir you said the experience is great right and it's a great brand so I'm paying for it no so what's the problem correct it's not their fault that they've built an amazing product great branding great experience that's a good thing the problem problem people who can't afford it buy it buy it only if you can really afford it I can afford it it was on sale I know your salary you [Music] can't cool one question when did you buy this iPhone uh 2 years back okay and uh this iPhone was worth how much 80,000 I think and your salary back then so this is worth how many times your salary back then four months okay hold onary is equal to one iPhone because it was good good features I this is good you'll stay here longer but it's not good for your personal [Music] finance so tell me how did you go and buy it to for I went to the store and I got the box and I unboxed it and the iPhone was on my hand and then I peeled off that screen thing and my iPhone was here and this is exactly why apple is worth a trillion dollars it spent so much on its branding to understand exactly what aspiration means ke you will pick an Apple phone over another phone which has better features that's what a company does know they'll tell the user about the features hold on if you look at this table over here you'll see that this other phone is larger in inches better storage better video the camera is better and the price is cheaper but someone won't go for the better features they'll just buy a lower model of iPhone because iPhone the brand the quality feels good it feels like you've made it I won't blame you but you should know that this is happening okay sir I that I understand it's really expensive it was for 1 lakh rupes but on the sale I was just getting it for 70,000 only I would have perfect this is called a phased out discount congratulations look hear the story very simple there'll be an online e-commerce seller who will say we have this big day where we'll do all these discounts and you should get ready you'll get prepped and you'll start saving you'll say okay I'm going to get ready to buy stuff and one day you start getting ads this ad says that now your iPhone worth 1 lakh is now at 70,000 rupees which is something that you saw and you feel the anchor is 1 lak 7 yes let me buy it correct so this is called the anchor effect where you compare it to 1 lakh versus 70k I'm saying compare it to your salary you know what I'm saying see what I did there which is okay no no no no no it's it's problem can't afford it if you can afford it it's totally fine in this case it's not possible anyway they'll keep moving from 70k to 72k 72k to 75k 75k to 77k and it'll make you feel ke let me just buy it and this is a psychological trick against you you have to look here and not look there and think can I just afford 75k or not if you can then you go ahead and do it we did a bunch of videos explaining how much debt is good debt and that tells you what percentage of your salary could be an Emi check that one out video with the the Jordan Emi I don't think I can afford it exactly that's the calculation you have to do not this calculation okay sir one more point I can't afford it maybe in full cash but I can go for no cost emis no that will save my money actually no cost Emi you're right is no cost Emi but it's not exactly no cost there is some cost involved um I can actually find it a cost on the website okay so over here basically so you're paying some interest on uh your emis obviously that's why you have that every month installment there is an 18% charge on the interest so that is something you have to bear there is also a processing fee that you have to pay that's one thing and actually if you look at this table you'll see over here that the price of the iPhone was 1.5 lakhs the total cost in a no cost situation where you think it's actually 150 divided by number of months the total cost is actually 1.55 so of course it it is low but um it's not no it's 1.55 there is some amount of payment that you do so is it for real yeah it's real actually I still think no cost Emi is a great invention of capitalism but there is one problem the scary thing is how many people are using credit to buy stuff everyone yeah actually the number is here it is 70% of people in India buy an iPhone on emis now I want you to guess forget about yourself forget about abishek do you think the general public 70% of these guys who've taken an Emi iPhone can they really probably afford it most likely they can't so all these emis are actually done by people in your age group 25 to 34 their average salary is 33,000 I'm talking about metros I'm talking about Pune Mumbai Delhi I'm not even talking about tier 2 cities I know you're above 33 but uh generally people can't sir if I'm putting in so much money buying that iPhone is also an investment for me an investment for you how Now understand this I'm going to buy an iPhone next year the cost is let's after this one you going to buy another one assume a situation and the cost is 130,000 right I went to the store I gave this phone to him got it and sold this for 30,000 that's a discount no now 1 lakh kphone and plus more discounts if at that moment and I'll get it for 60 70,000 it's an investment oh my God h no God please no it's completely wrong so this is actually called this um you're on this pleasure treadmill okay so here it is when you buy something new you feel really excited about it and then you feel and then normal life kicks in you feel normal about it then a new phone comes out and suddenly you don't like it so much so you need a new high and for that new high you just go ahead and buy the new one and then once you have you get used to it and then there's a new phone that comes off and you're not happy again and the cycle repeats in fact a smaller shorter version of the cycle happens when you're watching reals you watch it it's really funny and then then it gets boring then you move on to the next one and you get a new dopamine hit and a new one and a new one and with every dopamine hit you want just a new dopamine hit and this unlimited treadmill doesn't end with just this phone you'll want a charger you want the airpods you'll want a bunch of other things because it'll stay connected oh and you'll always be happy and you'll keep spending right and that's not what you want so very simply the best things are available in the world great you have to find out whether it's an actual need or a want now if this phone is improving and adding more income to you then it's a need then you should get it but we got you the MacBook which is office property and that's what you need it and you have it now if you don't own a phone and you're buying your first phone and you really need it maybe it's okay but not in this case dude this is a never-ending treadmill I'm trying to save you money okay sir with this idea no this treadmill idea I'll never buy expensive stuff so what am I working for you're working for to actually buy the luxury experience one day correct let me explained correct what you have to do is you have to make sure your Basics are taken care of luxury is different from expensive luxury means something that feels nice is expensive but you don't need expensive is it just costs a lot of money you may or may not need that's the difference the real tool of money is to act like a safety net the first safety net is yourself road the second safety net is your family they should be safe the third safety net is push comes to shove you have to switch a job you lose your job something happens you're comfortable for a bunch of months and this is outside of your emergency fund you don't want to touch it the fourth safety net is your skill is so good you are never worried about earning this is the real tool of money once you feel safe with these safety nets you will never feel scared and once you're never scared your performance in your work is going to be amazing is that worth a phone or a car or no it's not your freedom is the most important thing that you can buy but you let it go because of these small things which is why we made this episode so tell me can you really afford an iPhone now so the definition of affordability has changed I'll tell you how once I followed your uh followed the basic checklist right uh emergency fund insurances family etc etc now the amount that I have after considering everything now I'll probably see within that amount if I'm if I'll be able to buy that product or not is the definition of affordability yeah makes sense Hanah very nice I'm so happy so proud of you yes finally he understood if you like this episode this time I'm going to say like And subscribe say nice in the comments and see you in the next episode see you T just because T me that's wrong right iPhone it's beautiful you see [Music]",

    "title_current": "Why Indians have ZERO Civic Sense",
    "transcript_full": "Sir, shoot. Correct. No, I Let's do something else today. Sir, dude, like we've been doing financial videos for 2 years now. And what's the point? The point is not to get financial freedom to buy things. It's to have peace of mind and be happy. But how can you be happy when you're driving? Suddenly someone cuts you off and insurance premiums rises. Tumhara Ma because he's a rash driver and then I was taking a turn. Someone actually threw garbage and our taxpaying money will be used to actually pick it up. So today I'm going to talk about something that we have not. How civic sense actually affects us in more ways than you think. Our happiness and also how it's affected financially. Let's do this rule. What's civic sense? It's an unsaid rule where you learn by looking at other people on how to behave in public, how to care for the environment, the community, people around you, being polite. But unfortunately, we Indians lack civic sense. [Music] We did a fun experiment. You see this area over here near the office is quite dirty. So we got it completely cleaned. Chucka chon. Very beautiful and span. And this other side of the road was actually quite dirty as well. What we did was we sort of added a little bit of litter. And then we observed for a few days on what actually happened. And the result will actually shock you. But you know a lot of my friends living abroad say key Indians don't have civic sense because of education. Now near our office everyone's obviously educated that's why there are offices right and this place is dirty. So clearly it's not education it's something else. So I found three interesting things of why this is happening and how it's affecting us economically and well just our happiness. The first one is tragedy of the commons. This is when you see someone throwing out garbage to keep his car clean or the house clean at the expense of the society. When humans exploit shared resources for their own benefit and basically everyone else can't use that resource, that is tragedy of the commons. And what's more shocking is that recently there was a yoga day organized in Visac, a community event where you can come learn yoga, perform yoga. Good for your health, great for the community. But everyone did this. They ran and started stealing the yoga mats. Literally snatching it from each other. But you know what's even more sad? The yoga mats were actually free anyway. So all you had to do was queue up and everything was there for you anyway. And that's the sad part. You see, when the community is incentivized to break the rule, as in when someone breaks the queue, he gets the benefit, someone steals the mat, he gets the mat, and nothing happens, that's when tragedy of the common becomes worse because everyone is incentivized to break the rule. And then we have road accidents. In 2022, India witnessed 4.6 lakh road incidents. That's almost half a million. and that took 1.7 lakh lives. The thing is out of this 1.7 lakh deaths, 1.2 happened due to oversp speeded. This means that these deaths could have easily been avoided. I'll tell you one more thing. We were in Italy recently and I'm absolutely not comparing our country with another country. But when we were there and I saw 60 km and it was an open highway, I could have easily touched 120. But because I was outside and everyone was following the rule, I stayed at 55. And can you imagine this side was completely free. Nobody overtook me because it was not considered good civic sense over there. And then we have the best of all, theft. And let's take an example of say the railways. We love taking trips in trains, right? There was actually a lot of theft in trains as you can imagine. I'm talking about bulbs, pillows, cloth, linen, uh the mugs, anything basically you can pick up was stolen and this was 260 cr rupees in 2022. And how does this affect us? Well, one it contributes to the losses of the Indian railways which means fairs will go up. All of these costs will be passed on to you the taxpayer. you will have to pay a high affair because someone stole something. But you know the tragedy of the commons is only one aspect of civic sense. Another aspect is actually the broken window problem. So let me give you an example. Imagine you go into Delhi Metro and we sent part of our crew. We said just record the place and see if someone is eating or has any kacha in their hand and just try to record them. You'll notice they don't throw or litter across the Delhi Metro and it's actually really really clean and well organized. But the same person once he goes down, exits the Delhi Metro, walks on the street, throws it on the street. Another example is a normal railway. You enter a bogey, you'll see someone eating peanuts and then they eat the peanut and take the chilka and throw it right there. And they do this because everyone else is doing it. No one stops them. They don't stop anyone and they say it's their job. And this is called the broken window theory. Basically, if there's a broken window, people find it okay if another one breaks. But if something is pristine and beautiful, people want to maintain it. And this is not just about our country getting dirty and we're complaining about it. It also affects our health. 40% of all plastic is thrown on Indian streets. This blocks drains and floods and our streets during monsoons. It becomes a breeding ground for diseases. It harms street animals because they're the ones who will eat the trash and it pollutes the soil, water, and enters our food chain because that waste just hardly gets cleaned. Now, I know you'll think that when something is dirty in a public place, the government is supposed to clean it. But we can't blame the government for our lack of civic sense, right? I mean, look at this example here. street food falls on the street and they go pick it up and throw it in a dust bin and the place is clean again. If this happened and you're eating, will you actually bend down, pick up that wet waste food and throw it in the dust bin? Another tragedy is tourism. The largest concern of travelers trying to come to India's tourists is I'll get sick. And you'll also go on the internet, you'll find hundreds of videos with millions of views where they're showing how dirty India is. And that means other foreigners also think India is dirty. And this is really embarrassing for us. Think about the negative impact it has on our country. People don't want to travel and tourism takes a hit. So I don't know what the solution to this is, but I found something crazy. As children, we're not really taught to clean up our own mess. Think about it. When you eat your food or if there's something dirty, there's either the kwali buy at home to pick that up for you and wash the dishes or it's mommy. You don't have in your brain a thought that because it is outsourced to someone else. And a second reason is um more embedded in our history. If you look back at India, our society has been divided into this hereditary kind of structure where cleanliness has been outsourced to a different part of society, a marginalized part of society which does the cleaning. So because someone else is supposed to do the cleaning, all of us don't have a shared responsibility of public ownership of cleanliness. And this is called the endowment effect. The moment you feel shared resources are your own, you start to take care of it. Let me give you an example of um Japan. So over there you'll see no ch actually going to school all on their own. And once they're in school, they'll even clean their classrooms because it's ingrained in their culture that this shared space is my space. So they actually care about it. So when they grow up naturally the entire population thinks of their city, their country as their own and not belonging to somewhere else. Therefore they take care of its cleanliness and other things. In India, if you are following the rules, you'll get awkward steps. At least it's happened with me. Now let's start with solutions. But I need you to post your solutions before you hear these so we can actually compare notes in the comments. First one starts with cold play. So a friend of ours went to Amanda Amanda for the Coldplay concert and I'm sure you've heard of those moon glasses right which make things look all cool. So there were 1.5 lakh people going over here and they thought they might not get the moon glasses. So they went to this one guy who had it and there were like 100 200 people there and our teammate is telling us that everyone is reaching out and saying glasses. The organizer shouts at the top of his voice saying, Not a single person gets these moon glasses until you form a clean queue. Everyone formed a single file line and they stood and everyone got those glasses.This is enforcement. Once you enforce, people will do and you do not incentivize bad behavior. You incentivize good behavior. We need this from the government and us from each other. The second is contacting your municipality. If you have an area which needs to be cleaned, they are managing a really large area. Inform them, tell them and you will see something happening. You should actually take shared responsibility of everything around you and you can actually affect it. For example, Noida and Delhi actually has an app where you can inform them when something is dirty or something needs work and it reaches the correct authority. I mean that's amazing, right? Before we move to point number three, I want you to guess what happened to our experiment over there. So the results of the experiment are not surprising. The place which was actually dirty became a little more dirty and the place which was clean continued to be clean. We did not nudge anyone over here to do anything. If someone makes fun of you, you should actually be the change. And I'm not saying this as this boring philosophical ending. I actually have an interesting story here. Swati and I used to stay in this area in Noida where there was a playground and the playground obviously had lots of children and there were six puppies. Now these six puppies were complete strays and the kids were actually kicking each puppy and the puppies were crying and every time a boy kicked and the puppy cried everyone clapped and laughed. So we actually did something simple. We didn't say anything to the humans. We went to the puppies, put them on our lap and started cuddling them. The puppies quickly went to us and they felt safety and the children said something amazing. They said Swati says and the same kids who were kicking actually squatted down and started petting and started saying al and their behavior changed in seconds. And I realized humans are exactly the same. The moment you show them what's correct and everyone agrees because everyone is doing the right thing, everyone continues to do the right thing. So the change actually starts with you.",

    "title_current": "Double your money with penny stocks | De-influencing",
    "transcript_full": "video penny stocks can go from 5 rupees to 500 in a matter of weeks so we thought why don't we create a portfolio for you and give you a playbook so you can create one of your own and make all that moola just like this portfolio right here which made a 100% return last year and who knows how much money it will make this year so without further ado we'll do this in three steps step number one we will filter all the stocks based on a price criteria step number two we will filter stocks on another technical criteria and step number three we'll add a fundamental criteria and this is the most important part but in true deal twencing style we will talk about the risks the actual risks because these guys don't talk about it so let's start with step number one but before that hit that subscribe button right now to understand step number one we'll need to understand some history the year was 1929 and the world suffered the greatest economic setback it had ever seen the great depression but during this time we saw the economy collapse jobs vanish and people were left homeless and of course the stock market crashed because of this in 1934 the us government created the sec the securities and exchange commission to regulate the markets one interesting thing happened from this and that was the regulation imposed by the sec and that was any stock priced below $5 was not allowed to list on the public exchange and the term penny stocks was born since then the perception of penny stocks ahem well has become similar to a lottery ticket most people lose but a few win and they win big ahem by chance perhaps and so the frenzy of penny stocks grew to a global level even here back home in india penny stocks penny stocks penny stocks penny stocks penny stocks penny stocks penny stocks penny stocks so there are about six ninety eight stocks in the country below 10 those are our penny stocks so for step number one i'm going to put this in the screen and say current price less than 10 and i'll run this query here's what i get i have 700 stocks do not buy any of these stocks it can be really dangerous wait till step number three because the final step is the most important step but i think one thing that's important is that from all these companies we need a stock that is a superstar how do we find a superstar i know let's add one more criteria a stock that has gone up 100% so i'll add it and here return over one year is greater than 100% and i'll run this query now i have 26 companies but i want a portfolio of 10 or 15 i wanna be focused right so let's do that and let's slowly move to step number two and over here we're going to add another criteria step number two has to do with liquidity and liquidity is really important wait let me just show you so imagine this is your stock and there is just a kuch bunde paani inside it and you trade a little bit of it see that that's a problem i just manipulated this little basket over here and that's exactly what happens in a small cap with a bunch of shares it could be 10,000 20,000 maybe even 1 lakh rupees i can move the stock price from here to here and it may seem amazing but there is just very little water or very little liquidity in that stock but if i buy 1 lakh rupees worth of reliance it won't matter i cannot move the stock simply by placing an order but i can do that on a really really small penny stock but why does this matter to you it matters to you because if you have your money in a small company like this a few people or even one person can manipulate it so you have to stay away from it so we have to make sure we add a criteria where we remove illiquidity from the scanner and all i'll do over here is scroll down and i'll add this criteria volume one year average is greater than 50,000 now we could also choose to look at daily average volume which would be more technically correct but anyway we'll use this one for now and i'll run this query but before i do that in 2022 like i said there were about $6.98 penny stocks they're only two eighty nine about 300 which are actually being traded in 2023 the rest have no trades at all so imagine they could be listed but there's no activity happening at all and the stock is priced at x what a waste let me run this query and see what happens to our total as you can see over here we have only 13 stocks now but don't trade any of these because they still can be risky and we have to gently move into step number three and over here we'll actually run a fundamental check but with penny stocks because they are so awful we thought we'll just run the most simplest one you see this company and this company over here proseed and geeta don't their charts look beautiful imagine you had them in your portfolio well i hope you would not have them in your portfolio because their sales are zero i don't mean 1 rupee don't mean 2 rupees it's actually zero but the stock went up i have no idea why anyone would buy them but i do feel people get influenced just looking at price so we thought we should add a fundamental check to this shouldn't we so i have a few fundamental checks over here i'll just copy paste them one is sales growth should be growing for five years and the other is that return on capital employed should be greater than 10 pretty simple i'll just add them and run this again as you can see over here we've got a grand total of zero finished no stocks and this is the answer to any penny stock portfolio if you are a retail investor and you want to create a penny stock portfolio you are thinking from greed and you have to move away from this infinite greed machine that is the internet telling you that you can buy x y z stock and make money there are no freaking shortcuts in the world and you should avoid it as well think about buying an index fund make sure you have your emergency fund in check make sure you have health and life insurance your goal set some large cap some mid cap and if you have some money left you can think about trading but never ever think about penny stocks because if something is too good to be true it probably is the problem is not the price of the stock the problem is that there are no traders over there so there's a liquidity issue the second problem is a lot of these companies are fly by night operators which means they show up one day and they leave the second sometimes the promoters are shady sometimes the business model doesn't exist sometimes there's just no growth no vision no team and all of that why would you take all of that risk and all of these things put together is what possibly makes a good company and if all of them are questionable why would you even try some stories like seeing blue chip companies priced at a few rupees and then growing up to be thousands of crores and lakhs of market cap is completely different those may not have been penny stocks maybe the company was priced at 5 or 10 rupees but the market cap was a thousand crores price and market cap are different things but anyway let me tell you two issues over here one is pump and dump imagine i have a telegram group and i tell everyone to buy this one company whose volume is 10 not 10 lakh not 10 crores just 10 shares and all my thousands of people in my telegram group buy it it moves up just like this from here all the way up to there and all i have to do is sell again the problem here is not telegram or any communication method it's the price of the stock and the liquidity people push the stock and it got pumped and then the person who's manipulating it dumped it and made a lot of money in this case the operator buys way before he tells people to purchase that stock hence it's called the pump and dump and this is really common the only way you can stay away from it is stay away from it the second is insider trading imagine the same thing being done by an insider of the company it could be an employee it could be a promoter etcetera etcetera and any of these companies could run this because they know the business isn't working but if i do some nice advertising people will buy it i already own the stock or i'll release some kind of news maybe the employee knows a piece of news is going to go out as soon as the price goes up he sells it but all of the issue is basically to do that the company has no future and illiquidity causes the price to be volatile the simple thing is just stay away our brains are programmed to find sugar wherever we see dessert we wanna gobble it up and in finance greed is the dessert and we feel there's so much of greed being sold in the markets someone should actually attract you with the greed by saying stuff like penny stocks work etcetera explain the entire process and show you the truth that in reality it's something you should avoid we think it's a great tool for education and we've created the de influencing series if you can tell us what the next few episodes we should cover in this series let us know we will tell you everything including the risks so you can make the right decision well hopefully hit that like hit that subscribe because if you don't get that encouragement there's no point in working so hard in making this stuff so hit that subscribe button right now looks tasty are you rolling why are you rolling for nolan and that criteria is in my script which i don't remember what is it my wife's so loud no love you are we recording",

    "title_current": "Rent vs Buy a House: The 4-2-0 Rule",
    "transcript_full": "this house costs 1 crore to buy today but i could rent it for just 30,000 a month so how do i decide between the two this excel sheet has the exact plan you need to figure out your rent versus emi debate so first we're going to understand the economics of buying a house then we'll move to rent and what it means to rent for the next decade or two decades then compare which one was actually more profitable let's assume it's a 1 crore house the down payment is 20 lakh rupees this is what you are paying from your pocket to buy this house the loan amount is obviously 80 lakh rupees remember everything you see in yellow is editable so this will be different for you but let's understand with this example first the loan interest is 9% the loan tenure is twenty years so your loan for 80 lakh rupees is going to last for twenty years this brings us to our emi of 72,364 rupees so what does your house cost all your friends will say your house cost is the loan 80 lakhs plus 20 lakhs that you put in 1 crore rupees and that's the value of your house in the future when it becomes 2 crores they'll say bai mera ghar to double hoga but this is wrong here's how you actually calculate what the house's cost is first is the cost 1 crore then you add on top of this all the interest that you paid to the bank because that is also a cost you're paying over twenty years and and that's also compounding not for you for the bank so if you add that your total cost becomes 1.73 crores that you're repaying to the bank add the 20 lakhs and it's increased a bit more but that's not all you also have associated owner related expenses when you own a home you will spend on things an owner spends on which means you'll spend on annual property tax this is about 50,000 rupees for this property and it increases by about 5% every year you add that up for twenty years then you have society maintenance this is 50,000 rupees and increases about 5% a year this becomes 16.5 over the next twenty years then you have house maintenance you will constantly have to maintain the house so that's about let's say 10,000 rupees per year i'm taking a really low amount by the way and putting 5% increment on it about three and a half lakh rupees i do think though people can spend a much large amount on their house because it's their house it's the most emotional thing they'll ever buy and they will spend whatever they can to make their house a home but since it's an excel sheet let's take a small amount when you add all these three things up total cost of the house is 2.3 gross i want you to pause here and think about this this the house isn't yours until you've repaid the entire house loan but the beauty of owning a home is that it's not like a car or a dining table or whatever a spare of sneakers which wears out it goes up in value so the value of this house has gone up to an incredible amount and we'll calculate that and we have a net gain but we'll have to compare this with the renter first let's see how much rent you've paid remember 30,000 rupees every month at a 10% yearly increase for twenty years i know that's a lot of numbers that's why we have an excel sheet so look at this column over here column c you can see $3,030,000 30,000 and then suddenly in year two it becomes 33,000 because plus 10% then i go to year three it becomes 36,000 so on and so forth all the way down it keeps going up and you're eventually paying almost 1.8 lakh rupees in rent and when i add all this rent up it becomes 2.04 crore rupees wow so maybe your mom and dad were right you're paying so much of rent you might as well buy a house you paid 2 crores in just rent over the last twenty years but there's one more aspect over here we also have an sip and the sip was calculated on this person's emi minus this person's rent whatever is the differential so that both of them are having the same outflow of a certain amount in this case it's 42,000 rupees so $42,003.64 as you can see every single month you have invested in year two that 42,000 has become 39,000 you know why because the rent has increased so the sip has reduced because the outflow has to be the same this has to be a fair comparison then let's go to year three the sip has reduced even more in year four even more so you see every year the sip is not increasing which it should it's actually decreasing because we want to make a fair comparison between buying and renting the place and by say what month 01/20 the sip becomes zero 01/01/2021 actually becomes completely zero the rent he's paying is equal to this person's emi so now nothing's happening so he's only invested for one twenty months anyway this amount this sip grows over the next twenty years and that value of your future sip investments is 1.57 crores not bad we can also see that there was an original lump sum remember the eighteen something lakhs we invested in the first year that has now become 1.26 crore rupees so the net gain from renting is 79 lakh 36,000 provided he invests that differential amount over the next twenty years wow if rent made so much money i can't wait to see how much the capital appreciation happened on an owned house we can see we have years and we have emi the emi is 72,000 rupees comparable both are spending the same amount one is investing one is investing in the house most of your emi when you pay to buy a house goes towards the interest of the bank not in equity of your home so just look at this 83% 80% 80% 79% for many many years up till year five every single payment that you're making up to 75% even in year five is going towards interest payment it's only about twelve years and seven months where it becomes 50% interest 50% principal in other words in the first ten years most of the money went so that the lender could profit not that you could own the home so the question value of the house over twenty years compounds and grows to a grand total of 2.32 crores the net gain is 2 lakh rupees this means clearly in this situation the rent person actually made more money all of these yellow boxes will change so your answer will be slightly different in most cases unless you're putting a really large down payment or you're not investing this money the numbers will roughly always have the renter to win so when you were 10 years old the best part of your day was going out playing with your friends until you got tired and then you played a little more and then it became 12:00 mom said andhra and you continue to play and you played some more then you played some hide and seek then you laughed looked up at the sky until it was evening and you came back home tired mom gave you food and you slept then in class ten and eleven and twelve you had to follow a schedule you had to get up on time do revision go to the school do test prep study a little more you could not go out the entire day and study and your life became restricted to that one thing which was your board exam class 12 is like taking a home loan you are no longer free like you were when you were 10 years old where you could just go out into the sun and play the entire day without any worry within class 12 you will compartmentalize into a schedule and you are now sort of working for this other version of yourself which had to get 99% or whatnot in class 12 if you take a really large loan then you'll be forced to be in class 12 forever preparing for your boards forever go to work forever to pay that emi you can't take a break because if you do you won't be able to own that house that you're trying to pay for you must optimize for freedom and experiences and no one should force you to do anything you must have options maybe that's what freedom is for adults and youtube is full of all these videos talking about 5% rule and 8.75 rule proving one of the two your job is not to look at a rule and make a decision your job is to understand this excel sheet deeply because a rule can't actually tell you what to do with your life so that's why we talked about the four twenty rule everyone wants to have a formula there's no such thing we did this to trick you so that you feel that there's a formula but actually there's none i want you to fill this up read it understand it shut down your laptop then sleep get up the next morning and your heart will tell you whether you should buy or whether you should rent fourteenth march you can experience all of this so head on to the app complete the missions and earn your free pass",

with us who will answer the very important question so pratik why couldn't vandit sell his shares well I don't know about that but something was definitely wrong with that app that trading app was completely fake and just like him there are many innocent victims out there who are losing money to these fake trading apps in fact this story here talks about someone losing lacks of rupees by moving from a legit app to a fake trading app so in this episode we're going to talk about the good well not really mostly the bad because no one else will so let's get [Music] started now fake trading apps are a problem but the last few months it's become worse C online trading 43y old man from the Indian state of Hyderabad lost around $107,000 to Whatsapp investment scam date May this is the biggest motty of cyber crime in which people are losing maximum amount of money and if you read these headlines you'll realize what a big problem it is like here cyber Crooks Now set up fake online trading platforms to snare investors in 2 months 110 people in Pune lose 18 crores fishing alert Chinese cyber criminals Target Indian investors with fake brokerage apps lowed by high-profit two people lose 7 CR to Stock Market trading cyber fraud but the question to be asked here is why are so many people falling for these scams and how can you identify it so let me put you in the victim shoes so let's say you're working in your office it's a normal day well it's pretty boring actually and you get a WhatsApp message from someone saying you can earn 10 to 20% a week in the stock market and all you have to do is join a WhatsApp group now of course you know 10 20% possible every single week but what's the harm in joining a WhatsApp group it's a boring day anyway so you click and you join this group inside the group there are 100 people all talking about stocks now this seems exciting at first but it becomes even more interesting when people start talking about specific companies they bought and sold in fact you'll even see people talking about how much money they made like in this one our team infiltrated we found a person saying they got 1 lakh rupees inside their account after trading on this app now what you want to do is you want a piece of the action and you click on the link as soon as the link opens you get Google Play Store you see lots of good reviews and you know ke up to you've seen 100 people screenshots Google Play Store also has great reviews lots of downloads and it seems really legit so you hit the button and you download the app now that you have your app you can't just use the app I mean there are some rules and regulations that you have to follow there is proper registration process and the admin is here to help you I mean trading app so well you follow the process and you enter your Adar and your pan and soon your account is now active so the next step is trading but you don't have money in your account don't worry the customer support team is here to help you so on WhatsApp you're talking to them and they say sir please start with 50,000 Rupees sounds like a big commitment but to make money and make my future right you should do it so fine we agree 50,000 Rupees it is imps UPI he says no UPI is not allowed rules are rules imps only and we get the bank details on our WhatsApp so you transfer the 50,000 Rupees via imps and then you look at the app and of course 50,000 Rupees reflects in the app almost instantaneously and the customer support doesn't stop there you get your first tip in the community and he says simply buy 200 shares of this stock it's going to go up2 5% in the next few days you immediately open the trading app find the symbol add it place the buy order and wait you now spent your money and you're waiting for the stock to do something and the admin says don't worry hold your winners wait for the next few days and you wait you check again on Thursday and the stock has done exactly what the admin said it's up 26% and you can see the profit reflected you go and tell your friends about it you're very excited it's actually working I mean look at that stock go and then you go back to customer support and say hey I need one more tip they say I know but the next tip you will have to invest 2 lakh rupees in an IPO it will give you 50% 50% 50% cool you arrange the 2 lakh rupees by borrowing from your friends imps you know the entire thing to the account you receive it in the account you open the symbol add it and invest the 2 lakh rupees hopeful that when it opens you'll get something then suddenly you get an email the IPO has been won I mean I didn't even know you can win an IPO I thought you get a lotted shares in an IPO this seems different now I just need to wait for the market to reopen on Monday and when it does you've made 65% how does it feel why weren't we doing this for the last few years I mean say but you have to have discipline so we thank the Stars thank the gods and most importantly thank this trading app that we've been using now comes the best part actually withdrawing your money and living the life you deserved so you message the admin saying thank you so much I've made all this money I would like to withdraw some money he says that's fine but you owe the Govern government 50,000 rupes in capital gains tax first imps me the tax then I will let you withdraw this seems a bit weird but he also made you make the money so it sounds fair so you transfer the 50,000 Rupees via imps to the customer support admin guy and then he message me say hey I've sent him the tax can you please check and let me withdraw the money the admin says he made you so much money what about his Commission so please transfer another 20,000 for his commission this is weird but I guess it's fair I mean you think about it he has been up with you he has been telling you what stocks to buy he opened the account helped you in everything I mean you owe him something right so 20,000 rupees cool so you go back to the WhatsApp find his Account Details send the imps take a screenshot show it to him and say dude I've sent you the money can I please withdraw my money he said yes but you know there is 10,000 more as platform fee that you need to pay at this point you're getting a little frustrated and then he blocks you and you have no other way of reaching out to him and you are confused what the hell happened and at this point you realize that you've been scammed the modus operandi is very simple most people don't withdraw money from their trading accounts they are driven by greed and and this is the main thing that the scammer wants you to do he's feeding off your greed so now let me tell you the red flags of this entire journey and after these red flags I'll tell you how to safeguard yourself from fake trading apps so I know in the story you just heard there were obvious red flags but there are some red flags you probably did not think of let's begin with one some random person's whatsapping you saying you can make money dude no one should randomly message you and say you can make money from this that itself is a red flag second all WhatsApp groups aren't bad but this one in particular sent you a link to download the app now when you clicked on it Google Play store opened when you clicked on it Google Play store opened when you clicked on it yeah I'm just repeating the same thing again and again right that was not Google Play Store this entire UI is a copy of the Play Store and look at the link above that's not the play. gooogle Android store that's not Google play it's just a copy replica so the number of downloads the reviews everything is actually fake in fact you can't click on anything on this page apart from that download button now this gives you two problems one is you're not actually downloading from the Play Store it's fake second because it's not on the Play Store there's a high chance that there is some malware so they could be stealing data from your phone as well moving on to point number three this is not an actual ual broker which means he does not have an actual broking license from the officials now if you look at this screenshot here you'll see that this looks exactly like kite but it's not it's actually a fake app the problem with these fake trading apps is that the front end is completely manipulated it is not connected to the National Stock Exchange or the Bombay Stock Exchange it's not connected to any of the intermediaries there's basically a guy in a back end who clicks on your account puts in an amount for your total amount in your balance selects the stocks changes the prices based on something maybe scraps it off the internet and shows it like prices are changing and makes it look like it's real so if he wants he can just move a stock up by 10% and show you in the front end that you've made money when in actuality that stock hasn't changed at all then the admin asked us that we have to invest 50,000 nobody I'm telling you nobody in the country can force you to invest any amount for any product push tactics within Finance generally is a red flag fifth you sent money directly to an individual's account how can you send it to an individual and hope that it reflects in your account that won't happen never send money to an individual now notice the scammer said use imps now there are two reasons for it one you cannot UPI more than one lakh to an individual account in one transaction and as we saw so actually get the victim to send you a lot of money you have to make sure that he can send more than a lakh in a transaction if it's possible so imps has a higher limit the second reason is it just looks really legit saying we do not accept UPI and only imps feels like oh there's some rules and regulations that these guys are following so maybe it must be right in fact one interesting thing happened in one of the communities we entered we found someone saying click on this link and send us UPI money of 1 lakh rupees and this community was accepting UPI so this individual sends us an address not in the app and we clicked on it and the UPI address actually said zeroa broking just to make you feel like it's going to a legit broker but actually it was mased it was going to an individual that I thought was a little scary but notice the system is made in such a way that when the transaction happens this is debited automatically which means your taxes Etc but the scammer was asking you to send him 50,000 rupes capital gains tax that's definitely not how the taxation system works now it's time for me to tell you how to safeguard yourself from these trading apps but before I do that there are three points I have to tell you on other ways that people are scamming using fake trading apps but was not included in this story the first one is that people run ads actual ads on Instagram on Facebook on your favorite social media platform with famous people as their faces this is an actual ad promises lots of money please don't believe such ads I've also seen people call from broken apps saying they're working there and say that you are special your account has been selected and and we will give you tips for free and teach you how to trade just download this app and we will grow your wealth with you and the worst thing is that some of these fake trading apps are actually available on the Play Store and because people aren't sure what's the real name of the broken app they just download this fake app use it and well you know what happens so how do you Safeguard yourself one never download anything outside of the App Store just make it a rule it's not difficult second if you do find something on the App Store open it up check the reviews check the name of the broker check who the developer is is the developer you know someone is the developer familiar is it the same broker or is it someone else check the website if you click on the website check the URL is the name of the broker correct is the website actually correct make sure you're downloading the correct broker's application and not just a fake one another way to scam is on the website when you click on it you misspell the broken name so I'll use zeroa as an example zeroa could be misspelled as Zera so check the URL for all spelling errors there shouldn't be any if the broker is unheard of you should check whether this broker is registered with sebbi I've left a link in the description if you don't see the name that's a problem the next thing is that every time you make a transaction there are multiple counterparties confirming whether that trade happened or not let me explain when you make a trade for example you will get an SMS which looks like this even in your email you'll get a contract note which tells you what amount was debited what was credited so multiple parties telling you multiple things about all of your transactions and if you come across something like this you should definitely report it using the cyber crime handle over here because so many complaints were happening we needed one channel one episode to just talk about this so cyber do is here to help if you have any complaints you can write to them tweet to them and they will reach out and help if you love this episode wait till you see the episode on fake government job scams that are happening in this country right in the comments de influencing Army see you in the next video",

    "transcript_full": "[Music] hello prik beta you finally reached abroad I'm so proud of you thank you so beta how's life there I have heard so many good things about Canada M the place is very nice we have wide roads the weather is good and the people are also nice Aha and how's work is it not hectic right n ma work is the best part I get to meet different clients and it's not like a normal boarding desk job you know so it's nice oh so good to hear bet but you must be missing her G there a lot of Indian restaurants so it's not a problem it's it's good same same pizza every day I need I need my spacious home my friends how will I even survive over here especially with this job this wasn't my dream why did I even come [Music] here all right something was definitely wrong here I mean lacks of students go abroad and lacks of people actually go to get jobs s in foreign countries but their expectations there is some mismatch here so in this episode we're going to De influence the expectation about what people have when they go abroad and all those expectations will meet with a reality check so we'll talk about the good and we'll talk about the bad cuz certainly no one else will so let's get started [Music] [Music] before starting I'd like to make it clear there's nothing wrong with going abroad of course there are a lot of opportunities of course it's an interesting idea to pick for you to consider having a career abroad the problem isn't going to a foreign country the problem is the expectation we have and people around us have of why we are going there so that's what we're going to De influence in this episode so first let's look at some stats Indians are actually going abroad more than ever in fact Indians are going abroad for higher studies more than 68% than the previous year this translates to 4.44 lakh students enrolled in universities which has now become 7.5 lakh students in 2022 so you can imagine how many people are actually going to study abroad and the total numbers are even more in 2019 there were about 1 million that's 10 lakh students studying abroad and this number is likely to be closer to 2 million students in the year 2025 so this is clear Indians love studying abroad and this number is increasing and studying abroad doesn't come cheap I mean the average US College charges anywhere between 10 lakhs to 40 lakh rupees and this is all in the student fees staying over there etc etc that money is spent on studying and if you look at the entire Market Indians spend about $47 billion a year that's billion with a B and this is expected to become 70 billion by 2025 so now let's talk about Indians going abroad to work over here the numbers don't disappoint in about 2 years 28 lakh Indians went abroad to work that's 2.8 million people that's about 1,000 Indians a day about 30,000 Indians a month all of these people going abroad to work so if you look at the trend you have people going abroad to study spending lots of money people going abroad to work and hopefully earning a lot of money as well but net net people are going abroad more than ever so why are Indians going abroad there could be multiple reasons one reason could be that there's way too much competition here watch the episodes on De influencing engineering and NBA to know what I'm talking about and because there's so much competition it's really tough to get a good job or a good pay that could be one they perceive outside to have lesser people and therefore their chances of getting a better job increased the second perception could be that abroad is just a nice place the quality of living is better the air is nicer the people are nicer it just looks so damn sexy in those Instagram pictures the third reason could be the NRI tag the status that comes with saying or from wherever he's back everyone in the society will think wow dollar he lives abroad and the fourth reason could be that they perceive abroad to be clean cleaner less chaotic and just a better place to stay because India is not as clean as it's perceived to be abroad but the thing about foreign countries is that we only look at the bright side because we have media television Instagram and all these other things that tell us that there is a better Greener lawn abroad and that we are not getting that Greener lawn so instead of focusing just on the good part we thought we'd add a little bit of the darker side so let's talk about the problems with going abroad so let's look at some numbers and I'll need a whiteboard for [Music] this okay economics 101 every economy goes through an expansion phase a peak a contraction phase a trough then an expansion phase again and so forth now no one can really predict when this happens because it doesn't happen uniformly like I've done it over here but it does happen it's completely normal it's a feat of an economy and it happens to every country in the world so the first thing you should know is that this expansion phase this is when opportunities arise new industry comes money comes companies are getting funded they're starting new Industries salaries are going up increments are good everything seems very nice during this phase at the peak people are looking back at data and saying dude last 5 years 10 years and the perception of the economy is this will continue forever because of XYZ reason then comes the contraction phase now remember contraction is completely normal it always happens when this happens first there is some denial the economy goes down maybe increments don't happen maybe the job opportunities are less a lot of companies shut down Etc it seems that the economy is bad and then you have the trough now why I'm telling you this is that India is here right now which means India also has a lot of opportunities look at this chart over here you can see this line represents the GDP growth rate of UK and we also have the GDP growth rate of India now baring the portion where covid happened if you look at just India India has been growing a lot so why should you say there are only opportunities abroad remember India's GDP growth rate is larger than the US in the last few years which means India has a lot of opportunities don't ignore that now if you're going abroad for a particular kind of industry make sure that that industry is in its growth phase and it's actually growing so my point is if you look at say Healthcare and Hospitality these two industries are growing a lot in the US so if you have a interesting and good opportunity over there then maybe you can consider it but manufacturing on the other hand has been declining for a while so taking an opportunity there to go abroad probably is not a good choice you should weigh the pros and cons of whether that industry is doing well or not before you decide and now let's talk about the qualitative information no one really talks about but I'll get rid of the so Point number one lack of jobs there are less jobs than they used to be right now so there are a lot of stories of people saying that they're considering options back in their home country because the momentum of the hiring that was happening a few years ago isn't there anymore so while the number of people going abroad is at record levels are there really enough jobs to absorb all of that Supply think about it you need demand to be increasing and Supply to be constant for salaries to go up if the supply is too much which is too many people are going abroad but the number of hiring is not increasing what do you think is going to happen to the opportunities the opportunities at least temporarily will come down in fact you can see a lot of stories where a lot of expats who are Indian are trying to come back and their queries to HR firms is are there jobs at cxo levels for me in India which means they're considering coming back to home base and this is not only us there is an interesting Trend happening in Singapore and Europe over here we can see that Europe is a tough market for freshers and Singapore says they prefer hiring singaporeans and not xats usually xats came with a Discerning skill that could not be found anywhere else and that's why they got preference but now it seems like locals get a little more preference because of their hom ground advantage and it seems like their upskilling is as well and because of this trend Indians are left with no option but to take up blue collar jobs and that's the expectation mismatch if you studied went abroad expected a certain kind of job and don't get it and you end up with a blue collar job because you have to uphold the money you spent you have to uphold the family respect that's a problem because this will cause mental stress Financial stress and of course you just get upset Point number two there's a hous in crisis the housing crisis is actually real there is no affordable housing across say Europe or Australia or Switzerland and all these places students spend 40% of their expenses on housing so let's look at a typical student trying to study in a college in Australia now once he figures out what college he wants to study at he has to figure out accommodation now the College can only accommodate 10% of its total students that's its limit because Jag they can only accommodate 10% so the other 90% have to find an off-campus accommodation and this could be somewhere nearby but the problem with finding a house nearby is that it's too expensive so they're only left with the alternative to find a house 10 or 15 km outside where it's slightly more cheaper but you know adding to the W the cost of these accommodations also went up by 15% in a single quarter point number three mental breakdowns you know this is something no one talks about now imagine you moving to a brand new city where you don't understand the language you don't understand the people or the culture and taking time to adjust to the city well take some time but the same thing imagine if you do in a different country it's the same thing but on steroids you don't understand the culture you don't understand the people you're still trying to understand the language and you feel a little alienated because your family isn't there and this is not a guess this is a reality for people who don't understand the culture they're getting into because maybe they don't consume the same media you do they just consume Indian media and suddenly go abroad and face the shock of their lives and they can't process it if you look at this article it talks about how studying abroad has become lonelier especially after covid-19 pandemic and international postgraduate students have had higher rates of depression anxiety stress thoughts other than the UK population and a few of them actually find help to find it now I'm not saying you can't go through this in India in your own country it just becomes a little more exaggerated when you do this abroad and if you understand this and know how to combat it you should be completely fine point number four house help you lazy person you there you lazy person I don't think you realize that all the help we get right now with a Mali coming home you probably have a driver there's probably someone who helps you with jarup POA you probably have a cook someone helps you with cleaning the house do you realize what a privilege this is can you right now close and thank your stars that you are able to have some of this because around the world especially in the developed countries this doesn't happen it's simply unaffordable to have any help at home you got to do this all by yourself the median salary of a house help in the US it's actually what $30,000 that's a lot even if this is a little exaggerated and you take a lower number that's a lot of money so people don't have any house help they do everything by themselves Point number five PPP or purchasing power parity now we all know that the cost of a bread in India is different from bread that you purchase in say Europe the purchasing power is very different this means a certain amount of money can buy a lot of things in India and that same amount of money can buy less things in say you so you can follow a PPP calculation to actually know what's the purchasing power of that amount for example a lot of people say I have a $100,000 salary abroad and you think 100,000 is equal to 83 lakhs damn but that's not the right way to do it the living costs are much higher than India so how do you sort of compare the PTV model helps here so what I'll do is basically take the $100,000 convert it to purchasing power parity and find the Indian number for it and the answer is 25 lakhs roughly so roughly 25 lakhs earning in India is equal to almost $100,000 abroad that's about 83 lakhs of course there are a lot of other things as well like your lifestyle decisions how you live where you go Etc and there's also a difference in tax so it may not seem as shiny as you think unless the salaries are widely higher like 200k or 300K and it's something you cannot achieve in IND even after doing this triple P calculation then maybe you should reconsider how much money you can make abroad and there's obviously an Indian culture advantage over here India naturally likes to save our savings rate are higher than most countries abroad so there is a culture of saving some money versus a lot of countries abroad spend more than what they have and a lot of people are in debt and they consider it to be okay I think mentally that's some advantage over the long term if you like this video right the influencing life in the comments tell us what other things we should cover and see the bloopers see you in the next episode let me tell you one harsh truth about being an adult when you get up you'll go straight to the office won't see the daylight and come back in the evening",

understand the mindset you'll be able to follow this the strategy pyramid which starts with the safety net and goes all the way to actionable steps that you can take I want to show it to you on an actual Excel sheet so this is a sip calculator where basically we're investing 10,000 rupees per month we've assumed a 12% return now if you scroll down you can see the number of months on the left if I scroll all the way down I can see the market value is about 23.3 lakhs in about 10 years this is the point where you feel I've been working for a decade let me show you something to reflect a little better let's go down to the 15th year 23 lakhs has now become 50 in the 20th year it's now become are the second cor happens in just 5 years the third cor 3 years the next cor 2 years fifth cor happens in one year 10 months notice every cor added takes lesser and lesser time which means 50% of your journey is actually hitting the first one CR and that's the difference between people hitting their first CR or next 10c because it's mostly about mindset and less about skill but let's get real can you really hit 1 or even 10 crores with a 50,000 rupe per month salary well we'll find out through the strategy pyramid we'll unravel this one by one and answer whether we can actually hit this number or not at the age of 17 when I started to trade I also wanted to spend time with my friends so I told my dad I am going to chandigar I'm going to get a job in a call center work the call center and trade so I can also have a life because I can't be at home the entire day my dad the next week dropped me to a bus station and said beta problem I'm there don't worry back then he was my safety net I could take a huge risk because I knew I had someone to fall back on but when you're an adult you're completely alone you have no safety net so you have to make sure before you invest you have to create a safety net for yourself in case of hospitalization something happens to your health maybe even there's a layoff and it's called an emergency fund it's a very simple fun if your monthly expenditure is 20,000 rupees multiply your monthly expenditure by 6 months or 12 months and this is your reserve safety net money The Next Step within the Safety Net Framework is to make sure you're taking care of your family if you have an untimely death then your dependence will be affected their lifestyle will be affected and they will not be able to maintain the life they have today which means you must take something called a life insurance a life insurance pure term insurance basically gives them money in case of your untimely death now for you to get there you need to be healthy therefore you should also get health insurance and health insurance is non-negotiable for two reasons one medical cost are going up by 11% a year that's almost equal to Nifty which means it's going to get more and more and more expensive every year second if you actually earn a lot of money even if it's not one CR if you get sick or a family member gets sick all that money is going there because this costs a lot and if you have corporate Insurance let me tell you that is not enough you need enough coverage and this is a simple formula to actually use and now we'll go to level two of our strategy pyramid and this is investing enough you see guys a lot of people start with a monthly sip of 1,000 2,000 3,000 this is great because it starts the habit of investing but I think you should find a way to invest 20% or more of your income in markets the reason is simple 12% cagr to be honest is mostly an informed guess no one really knows what your portfolio CGR is going to be so when you're selecting a mutual fund there are two options regular and direct now if you have a financial adviser a regular fund actually makes sense and you'll be paying him a fee but that's good because he's there to help you out but if you're a do it your self- investor you should pick a direct fund where the fees is less and this research by value research is really insightful for 20 years if someone invested this amount the difference between a direct plan and a regular plan shows a difference of almost 20 lakh rupes and the difference in this example is only 1% that 1% compounds over many years and creates a difference of 20 LHS now let's move to my favorite part in the entire strategy pyramid and that's lifestyle inflation now you've probably heard of normal inflation this is a basket of goods and the government says it's moved up by so much so you have 6% 7% the cost of living is increasing but has the cost of living actually increased by 6% for you for the last 2 years I'm sure you would have spent a lot more where did it go it went on the niceties of life you know the sexy things like the nicer shoes the better apartment because it has a better view you're basically doing discretionary spending stuff that even if you don't do it'll not affect your life as much but it does affect how you feel and I'm not saying buying an iPhone or a Mac or a Apple watch is a bad thing it's bad only if you can't really afford it you know a friend of mine for the longest time was at about 1.2 lakh rupes a month and for whatever reason he suddenly jumped to 2 lakh rupees a month I was so so happy for him this gentleman is older than me he's about 45 years old and I think he totally deserves it he's worked his entire life but when I spoke to him on the phone he told me you know I have another friend who earns one CR he's immediately comparing himself to the guy who makes one and I asked him how do you feel about that he said well I won't be able to get a really nice car but it's okay it's true the grass is always greener on the other side because it's fertilized with you will always want something more so here is my solution to you to break this chuckra view as soon as you get your 50,000 Rupees a month take that amount and immediately put it in your sip so now that investment has left the account you can't spend it second take a second amount from it where you will use your lavish spendings and put it in a different account make it a little tough to actually access don't have a credit or a debit card attached to it now what's left is what you see in your account you'll see a smaller number automatically you'll adjust your life based on that amount now when you want to buy a PS5 or a new laptop you'll have to make an effort to transfer the money from that account to this account and then make the purchase it adds a little bit of friction when you add friction you can actually make better choices because when you see money on your account it vanishes and this brings us to the most interesting part of the pyramid but I want you to guess what it is it's an investment product that gives really good returns let me explain when you're investing in Nifty at 12% cagr roughly your money is doubling every 6 years but this scheme actually makes you about 40% cagr which means your money will double every 1.8 years this means your Capital will keep doubling faster than most businesses can even do sounds interesting this my friend is the credit card business from the perspective of the credit card issuer they charge 40% a year roughly from their consumers which is you and that's how much money they can earn and you wonder why all these companies like Visa Mastercard have such beautiful looking charts but remember it works in the opposite way for you so every time you take a loan whether it's a car or a house even if it's groceries because that's what you can do nowadays you are doing anti- compounding and I want you to write in the comments right now I will not anti- compound the question is this that do you really own these objects or do they end up owning you and 2 to 3 months in a year if you're working for the government for the taxes you pay the rest of the months you're working for a bank who are you really earning all that money for so in your journey to your first cor the first three steps you have to do but this last step which is avoid debt is something like avoiding Temptation you should not take debt because it's easily available",

    "transcript_full": "people are working you're sleeping what's wrong sir I need 50,000 Rupees right now what I want to go on International vacation somewhere like Malaysia Singapore somewhere in Europe and I have 50,000 right now I need 50,000 more no so 1 lak I think you can do it in 40,000 and that's not possible I need it no no it is possible tell me what if I tell you exactly how to do an international trip in 40,000 rupees that is not possible but tell me no think about it safe four steps we look at each step we'll optimize it and we'll make a plan for you and then you can get back to work cool so look this is not so complicated basically you have these four things to look off in the actual planning of your trip if you can optimize each of them I think we can come to around 40K don't waste your time it's very valuable just give me bonus and I'll go 40,000 let's try Step One is flight how do you book a flight what kind of question is it all book of Lights app app you so Delhi Delhi to where do you want to go I I'll figure so let's say you go to go to a flight aggregation website like say Google flights or Skys scanner you get this option read it says Delhi to anywhere anywhere and you get this map swizerland budget bonus bonus correct bonus but you can also see all these cities over here so hoi in is Vietnam 17K K round trip I'm actually surprised you didn't know this a lot of people use these websites to find out nobody does that so we just open our phone open the app type the location and we just book the flight so basically if you know all the locations on this map find what's affordable find round trips what kind of pricing is it a direct flight is it a collecting flight can I actually even go to view flights there is even a price graph here so you know what's going to happen when I click on price graph what I will actually find out that the prices in February are actually cheaper so this actually tells me the price trend of anywhere I want to go it's not Market sir it's vacation no it's data data is awesome so your job is to actually hunt and find out what's the most affordable for you did you notice obviously what's the cheapest flight you can see over here correct but it's also 9 hours when the actual flight time is 5 hours and you pay 500 rupes more for the direct flight so what should you really choose 500 rupes more yeah so make sure it's a direct flight you can choose stops you can choose Airlines you can choose the location the date best most affordable place so basically now a little bit of your money now goes to the flight flights to I get it but what about the Visa let's move on to point number two let's just talk about the Visa first so now imagine a situation Visa office Vis visa intervie interview and after a couple of days the embassy says Visa rejected no no I think a better way to think about this is choose countries you have e visa and it's easier to apply well in the list of all these countries you can do e visa visa on arrival a lot of the places that you go the Visa actually doesn't cost so much money what place is that let me show you so basically you want to apply for an e Visa we're looking at Vietnam for example over here it's like $20 K around we recently went to Kenya and we applied the Visa can you guess in how many days we got the E Visa seven 7 days no less what's your guess 2 actually 10 minutes it's easy it's online you can do it yourself and it costs 2 to 3,000 rupees so it's actually not that expensive and you can put that back so it's fine put it back now because of this guy we're picking Vietnam but you could pick any other country you want the rules are exactly the same and in the description you'll find the list of the countries with all the EV visas to make it easier can we move to the next point the power of your currency what will you do once you're in a new country you'll try the food you'll go to interesting places you'll meet new people you'll try activities you can't do over here you'll make new experiences you'll actually expect the unexpected and that's why you're doing it right it's experiences over assets new things over hotels or flights what if I tell you everything you do in this country is is so expensive that you have to just stay in your hotel and come back for example if you went to say Europe a single bottle of water is € how would you actually enjoy yourself I'll take water bottle from India I not go to that country so you want to go to a country the Indian currency is stronger against that local currency look at this look at this Nepal rup Indonesian Rupa Bhutan and Vietnamese dong are actually weaker than India look at this meal over here this meal costs about €0 2,700 2800 the same meal over here is this very big number in Bali for a million Dong or half a million very very expensive this is 500 rupees my point is India is stronger currency in Bali than Europe and Bali has some amazing places Vietnam has some amazing places Nepal has amazing places Neal Vietnam take Vietnam you can go and figure out the culture the history the war the museum all these experiences is why you're going to Vietnam right to weaker currency helps it's cheaper yes moving on to Hotel yes that's the interesting part so I'll stay in a five star hotel budget it's 40,000 total if you're going abroad what is the one thing you want to do outside of your travel your hotel and the food chill chill means do you want to meet new people H he's a really nice thing if you're going alone right yes okay so if you're going alone you stay in a hostel now let's look at the hostel experience you can either stay in a single room just by yourself or in a dorm that's still your choice and this is still cheaper than staying in a fourstar festar hotel obviously because everyone over here is seeking Adventure that's why they're in a hostel they're usually young they want to explore the city the hostel is designed to get everyone to enjoy themselves so they will plan the trips they will give you options they'll even have activities during the day plan the trip for me for everyone and you can join in maybe they want to go for a campfire at night you can join them the hostel itself wants to stir excitement because for them they want you to post on Instagram so they get more customers it's optimized for experiences and how much do you think a hostel room costs for a night how would I know I didn't go now roughly it's about uh 2,000 Rupees it's not bad totally yeah so we have a little bit of money towards your hostel not a festar hotel so now the big question when you're abroad how are you paying for all this how are you paying for all this card credit card so there are actually three ways you can do it one is the credit card correct credit debit card second is something called a Forex card what card a Forex card just go to to your bank say I want a Forex card you can load money of Vietnam or anywhere else that you're going and the third option is just cash so let's look at one by one what you should do is depending on the country you go to you should speak to your bank and ask what is the markup fee the DCS the conversion rate and figure out what's the best option I'm writing okay yeah usually the Forex card will be the most effective because the transaction fee and the conversion fee will actually be lower than your credit or debit card that will save me more money it will save you some money uh the credit debit card is good for emergency then cash is really good you should carry some cash but actual cash you should carry of the local place because some places may not have a posos machine and you cannot transfer it online UPI is not there abroad India is quite ahead at that so taking cash is actually quite useful also when you're doing a transaction in a POS machine It'll ask you should you be charged in the local currency or Indian rupees what should you pick always no always pick the local currency conversion charge the conversion charge is reduced you save it cool oh yes so basically 40,000 Rupees is possible for an international trip if you optimize all these four different plans and make sure that the price is actually right so anything is actually possible and now that I don't have to give the bonus he can actually start working a",

    "title_current": "Gold v/s Equity, the truth about investing | De-influencing",
    "transcript_full": "this is gold it's for wearing it's not for investing let me tell you how to make money you see all these people they've invested in equity simple 12% cagr returns long-term Horizon you can become rich like them and like me and if you don't understand how to pick stocks invest in a simple Index Fund I mean p what is this this huh um that's right if you look at this data over here you'll see that gold actually beat Nifty but to understand that you'll have to understand a little bit of history and in this episode of De influencing we'll talk about gold versus Equity the truth we'll talk about the good the bad and everything in between cuz these guys won't tell you hit that like And subscribe and let's begin with step number one why is gold even precious think about how we use language and gold we think of it as precious that's why we say Golden Rule gold standard gold medal I mean think about the last time you said aluminium rule probably not and gold is precious and so was stuff like silver and copper and actually I have aluminium right here as well the same stuff you use to uh you know get your cafeteria food wrapped in and taken home in fact aluminium was precious just as gold way back but then technology advanced and people were able to take out aluminium and the value of aluminium has now been reduced to my tiffen but gold is not the same it's still tough to mine and even more difficult to actually replicate it's tough to make fake gold it's nearly impossible and that's why it still has some value gold is also really chemically uninteresting now if you look at any of these three things like silver or copper they'll actually degrade over time and of course aluminium will but gold actually won't even a thousand years from now it'll look the same so because it's chemically uninteresting is another property which gives it some value in fact 1/5 of all the gold is actually not held by people but by Sovereign wealth and what I mean by that is this we have all these countries like United States Germany Italy France even India they hold all of this goal and this is in metric tons think about how much gold United States actually has that's 8,000 metric tons compared to everyone else every single country knows that gold is considered a safe heaven think about currencies oil prices geopolitical issues all of these Commodities can actually change even a currency can become volatile when there is a war or simply there is economic turmoil but gold is actually one thing that unites all of these countries together and because of that these guys invest in a lot of gold and think instead of holding their own currency let me hold something that unites everyone that's this metal now we know gold has value but why do we need to include it in our Investment Portfolio so let me teach you a concept think about equities equities is relatively more riskier than say a fixed deposit or say gold basically it's a little more volatile so how do you reduce that volatility so first let's look at Nifty and TCS now I've picked these two stocks because they're both equity and they seem like two different Investments one is Index Fund one is TCS a soft software company but if you look at this chart you'll see that both of these instruments are connected to each other they are correlated in fact the correlation is 0.97 which means they almost move together that's interesting it has something to do with how it's weighted and how nift is constructed but the point is they are correlated they'll go up together and down together so now the question is what's the correlation or the connection between equity which is slightly more ke and gold so this is an interesting chart of three different asset classes first is we have Emerging Markets short-term treasury then we have government bonds which is long-term and then we have Equity now the question is how are all these things connected or correlated to gold and if I put this right here now if you look at all these asset classes connected to gold this number shows us that they're all connected zero which means they're independent of each other if Nifty goes up it will have no effect on gold or let me say will have an extremely low effect which is why it's a good thing to have in your portfolio because its movement is independent the second reason you should have gold in your portfolio is that it reduces volatility so we'll create this portfolio by putting 50% of our money in nifty50 which is the index and 50% of our money into gold bees now we've taken gold bees as a proxy of gold prices of course prices we could have selected maybe spot but it is easy to get this data so just bear with me and over here we can see the 50/50 weighted portfolio how it's doing compared to just pure Equity or pure gold so let's see what we have over here we can see that in 2008 Nifty gave us a minus 50% return I want you to imagine you've invested a large portion of your money a lot of your savings in the market and then suddenly you seeus 50% and maybe you put the entire money in Gold you see plus 24% not bad but if it was equated you would actually see only a minus 133% this means that you got the benefit of equity and gold and didn't lose too much money but it didn't make a lot but notice say a year like 2010 where our portfolio made a 20% then let's say we look at 2016 where Nifty only gave a 4% return and gold 12 but both them put together gave you 8 and half% the point is very simple the highs become a little lower and the lows become a little higher dampening or sort of reducing the volatility what's interesting is that no one knows how Nifty will perform and no one knows how gold will perform so should you even predict now the question is should you have gold to sort of reduce volatility in your portfolio I'd love to know what you think in the comments below another interesting thing about gold is its relation to inflation now inflation is actually not a bad thing any growing economy will always have inflation in fact without it growth cannot actually occur it's a feature of capitalism and in a fast growing country like India but if you look at this chart over here you'll notice that gold has beaten inflation 8 out of 12 calendar years so if you're ever worried about mangai gold is a great hedge against this mangai problem that you're having and this is the most important Point guys full attention on your screen right now you've made it this far you love this point remember when we started the video I said gold beat Nifty let me explain by what I meant so vandit okay of course I have another chart over here and this chart over here is gold versus Nifty what do you think this is going to look like we have Nifty here now you can see that Nifty is done uh fairly well over a long period of time let's look at gold and these are gold returns let's see how gold has done also give a shout out to vandit over here for all this work over here and the production team good job good job CLA now notice uh these are gold and Nifty stacked together the key is who is showing you what portion of the data so if I only pick this portion I can say hey Nifty beat gold if I go slightly further I can say hey gold just beat Nifty if I take this portion over here I can say gold and nift Nifty is awesome I might go a little further in time take a a smaller sliver and say hey gold is killing it and beating Nifty the point is very simple you can't really predict which asset will do what so it's best you have some participation in Gold I'm not saying gold is better I'm not saying Nifty is better but you can't say one is extremely good and the other sucks that is an incorrect statement what you should probably say is one is relatively more volatile than the other and yes that is true and then you decide according to your risk profile whether you want 10% gold 20% gold or whatever you think makes sense I hope this video actually cleared that part but one thing we didn't talk about we didn't talk about one thing how do you even invest in gold I mean should you buy these bricks should you buy it online should you do this sgb thing how does this work and without discussing how to invest in gold this video is just not complete so let's move on to the next section so the first way and the most obvious way for you to buy gold like our friend at the beginning is to actually buy jewelry or something like this now physical gold has two problems one is where do you store it you'll have to keep a lock locker and if you don't have a locker there's always fear of theft apart from that whether you buy physical gold or there's a digital equivalent as well called digital gold both of these options will attract tax so you'll have to pay some amount as tax on top of this and there's also a Cess on top of that as well something you should definitely know and if you choose the jewelry route which is this then you're probably going to pay making charges too another option which is probably the most interesting and probably the best option is sgbs sgbs are sovereign gold bonds are bonds from the government but backed with actually asly Sona so Sovereign Gold Bond have three features the first is it's a bond so you put in money and there is a maturity period and you have to hold till maturity just like any bond if you hold it till maturity that is 8 years you are not taxed on the appreciation of the gold that it mimics so if the value goes from 100 to 200 you keep that profit if you hold it till maturity you don't pay any tax on it the second thing is like I said it actually mimics the price of gold which means if you think gold is a good long-term asset this is a great way to actually benefit from it and the third is quite unusual it has a 2 and 1/2% interest rate that is paid out to you annually that uh will obviously attract normal taxes but isn't that interesting there's an extra 2 and 1/2% that you're getting on this so all these three things put together makes sgb probably the most attractive out of all the other options now sgbs are released from time to time and just like an IPO you can subscribe to them via this primary issue and you will get allotment and you get that 2 and a half% too but here's an interesting trick so if the price actually falls of gold then what you can do is you can buy the sgb in the secondary Market which means you'll buy it from another person who already owns it and the yield will actually go up you know why because the 2 and 1/2% was on that 100 rupees that initial primary offer but if the market fell to 99 that extra 1% is something that you actually make so it'll become larger than the 2 and 1/2% because of that fall now another reason of that difference could be that there is low liquidity in the market and because of that it's trading at a discount from its primary issuance level anyway the point here is very simple there's no best asset class every asset class has its own risk and reward profile and every individual like you has its own risk and reward Comfort level find what that is and use a mix of different assets second try to find out what you think about sgbs it's an interesting thing apart from just looking at physical gold and jewelry this is something you should read more about and finally don't listen to anyone telling you something is best there is no best and if there was there wouldn't be a de influencing Series so tell me what you thought of this episode and tell us what other things we should pick in our next series watch all these other videos in the de inferencing series we love it I even play vuli in one of these check it out and see you in the next episode and don't forget to like And subscribe and say yay 01 rocks bye [Laughter] guys [Music] don't",

    "transcript_full": "sit ma'am sit ma'am this ulip give you 20% return per year ma'am per year you should take it as soon possible but I think a term insurance will be better for me ma'am why you hate money why you want to waste it what do you mean ma'am see if you buy a term insurance you need to pay a premium for 30 years and you are so fit and fine by God grace stop nothing will happen to you till 70 years then why do you need to buy a term insurance instead of this you buy a ulip you will get a life insurance and also you get a 20% return on your investment really we put your money in mutual funds and when your policy ends you get your money back and the returns are completely tax free yeah then why am I buying mutual funds I'll buy this only congratulations ma'am okay something was definitely wrong with that insurance agent but let's think about ulips for a second it's an insurance and if you don't pass away you still get a return on your money that's pretty good right but it does sound too good to be true I'm going to tell you something about ulips that these insurance agents are definitely not going to tell you and will proberly missell you we'll talk about the good and the bad cuz certainly no one else will let's begin [Music] so let's talk about ulips or a unit link insurance plan insurance plan because well it's insurance and unit link because it's linked to the market just like a mutual fund so it's linked to well units every year when you pay this premium some of the money goes towards the insurance the term insurance and some of the money goes towards Market linked instruments actually it goes to a mutual fund and gives you market returns so you get benefits of both you get the death cover in an insurance and you also get the market returns isn't this a better product versus just a plain term insurance this is exactly what some insurance agents do to get a higher commission and missell you this product because usually a ulip may not be good for you so before we talk about the disadvantages let's start with the advantages of ulips okay about 41% people don't buy life insurance because they think it's not needed there's no urgency and they won't get a return so they just don't buy it with the ulip because you have death cover and you get returns some people will actually buy it and they'll get some cover for their life so that's a good thing second reason people don't invest in the stock market so this is a great way for people to start getting some exposure into Equity third there are taxfree returns that's always nice who likes paying taxes fourth Point unlike a normal term insurance where you're paying for 25 30 years in a ulip you can pay 5 or 10 years and get cover for like 30 years that's pretty good right it sounds like I'm getting a benefit for a long time but I'm only paying for onethird the time so that's nice but guys the pros are nice but the cons really outweigh the pros let's begin the first problem will surprise you you actually think that a ulip gives you both life cover and growth in your money it's actually not true you get either one only for example let's suppose you invest in this ulip and your money that you've invested within that ulip grows to 18 lakhs and your life covers 12 laks let's say in this example the ulip holder dies he should get both right he should get the 12 l and the market returns nope he will only get one of the two whichever is higher in this case it's 18 lakhs and that 12 lakhs is gone vanished imagine if you had invested in a term insurance separately and a mutual fund separately if a person passes away he'll get the term insurance benefit and he'll get the mutual fund return as well he should get both but in a ulip you get only one now let's come to problem number two low life cover now what's the primary objective about a life insurance it's so that your family can actually take care of themselves if the primary earning member is not there anymore right so you can't have a life cover of one or two lakh a rough way to get to a number is let's say someone earns 10 lakh Rupees a year his life cover should be at least a COR that's 10 times your annual income 1 CR rupees it sounds like a lot but if you divide it over 10 years it's not a crazy number for your family so you're paying 10,000 rupees a year to get 1 CR life cover in a term insurance okay I want you to guess how much you need to pay in premium in a ulip to get the same 1 CR cover I give you 3 seconds it's 5 to 10 lakh Rupees premium per year generally speaking a ulip gives about 10 times the life cover of the premium that you're paying and a term insurance does about, times there are some variables here I'm assuming it's a 25y old he doesn't smoke and drink etc etc but even if we change the variance a little bit and say you find a really good ulip which gives you 30 times or even 40 times which in some cases you may find it is still not comparable to A Thousand Times of what a term insurance gives so most people actually buying you lips don't pay a premium of 5 10 lakhs they'll pay maybe 10,000 and that will give you a cover of 12 lxs that's not enough so if you really want to get a good life cover for your family the best option is probably just a plain term insurance and then we have problem number three charges and returns so of course every Financial product has a charge to it and that's completely fine and should have return to it also fine because we all know what we getting into but when we talk about a ulip things change guys so let's read what this guy Reddit has written he says that he invested in a ulip for 5 years and it should have given him a 177% cagr you know how much he got 7% do you know why because of the fees now here's how it works first when you pay an amount to buy a ulip that premium some portion goes towards insurance and some portion goes towards your Investments now because a small portion is going towards investment your overall return will reduced right because the entire whatever premium you've paid is not being put in the market so overall your returns will reduce but there's a second problem here the portion which is now Market linked will not give you the same returns as shown in the mutual fund because the charges in a ulip are much higher than any other normal Financial product let's let's see an example let's suppose you invest 10,000 rupees into a ulip 500 rupees goes towards the mortality charges and 9500 Rupees is invested in markets and that year the market goes up and gives you a 15% return and this 9,500 becomes 10,925 nice but because you invested 10,000 all that money was not invested in the market so you don't get 15% you actually get 9.25% that's why the actual nav will always be greater than your actual realized returns so while researching for this episode we try to see all the charges that a ulip standard does but the truth is there's just no standard charge we have these three basic charges that all ulips charge the first is the mortality charge this actually goes towards your insurance then you have your management fee because some portion is being managed and put in equity markets the manager needs to be paid so that company needs to be paid so there is a management fee and finally there's a discontinuance fee if for whatever reason you stop paying your premiums you are charged a penalty now apart from this there are these fees as well anyway all these things actually add up and it makes it unnecessarily confusing and eats up your returns but let's move on to the next point the fourth point is tax returns so this basically means after after 20 years or whatever your term is once you get that money from the mutual fund portion that return will be taxfree now I'll be honest the taxfree is actually real and it actually makes sense but this is only applicable if your premium is less than 2.5 lakh rupees a year but generally it'll give you less returns than mutual fund so is it really worth it probably not disadvantage number five lock in and discontinuation imagine you buy a really nice looking ulip plan and you pay 10,000 rupees a month for your future now you're paying and life is going fine but suddenly covid happens now you use your emergency fund you pay the 10,000 for a few months but you've lost your job you can't afford this monthly payment anymore so you discontinue here's what the ulip does first you immediately lose your life cover but the money you've paid so far that was supposed to be invested in the mutual fund to give you returns is moved away from that to a discontinuation fund which gives you a 4% a mere 4% a year which means you're not making returns there either eventually after some time you figure out that they've also charged you other fees because you discontinued before 5 years and then you're watching this video thinking damn why did I invest in the ulip so in this case if you owned a term insurance and you sto paying for it of course the term insurance will also not do your life cover but the difference is actually in the details most specifically in the premium a ulip premium could be 10K but the term insurance premium might be 800 or 900 rup a month even if you lose your job you can probably still pay that 800 rupes or 900 a month right but paying 10K may be a little difficult so it is tougher to continue a ulist So within 5 years if you don't pay the premium then everything just doesn't work and you can't withdraw your money because it's a lockin for 5 years so you don't have access to that cash unlike say a mutual fund even if the market fell at least you can still withdraw it because you know it's your account problem number six Miss selling take a look at this ad look at that percentage return v v can you tell me what mutual fund this is it's not a mutual fund it's actually a ulip and uh a lot of people make it look like it's an investment product even recently the authorities said that any person selling a ulip cannot make it look like it's an investment product but a lot of companies missell it by making it look like it is a product that gives you great returns and if you look at the agents as well the agents are incentivized really well to sell it to you the commissions are really high and because of that they wanted to sell ulips and they did imagine you sitting across a table someone telling you all these good things how will you check who reads all the documents to make sure whether it's good or bad no one knows you need a01 to tell you if it's good or bad because we talk about the good and the bad and hopefully it helps tell me what you thought about this episode in the comments if you've heard about ulip for the first time or you know about it especially if you have a story about it here's a simple task for you to do to get featured on0 one's Instagram and on YouTube ask your parents if they've invested in a ulip or an endowment plan or any of these things and tell us the story the person who elaborates and tells us the story the best will get featured let's see if you can de influence your parents and see you in the comment section s p Lo Insurance next point [Music] truth welcome to De influencing now you have to get used to it it's part of your life nowra",

    "transcript_full": "sir abish why did you give me what's the problem it's good we gave you hike it's problem sir remember what you saide appraisal what you will help me increase my weth people are watching dude dude sh I don't think you understand this come here let me tell you come here AB this is confidential don't shout in front of everyone you knew this at the first place no I'll have to give CH L tax a how let me explain salary Beast L okay L okay tax 30% 30% now 20 lakhs into 30% is oh nice 6 laks okay and that's your tax liability you knew this n and this is another reason why you hate me a cal open your phone log into the HR software and click on tax liability it's 2964 hidden tax no this is the tax before screaming at me p how this works so in this episode for you and this guy let's understand how the tax system works and whether you should choose the old regime or the new regime and I obviously have a calculator as well for you because you still won't get it and a checklist that should solve all your problems let's understand okay ready yes let's go let's go save my money okay [Music] so magically I have these props laid out because I knew sir I was thinking let me just call my colleag just save [Music] people hi everyone Hi so sir I found out you're interested to learn how Tax Works what's wrong with you nerds okay so these are uh basically tax slabs we have 0% we have and then we have perfect and we have some fake money over here my favorite poker chips each poker chip is 1 lakh rupees and I have 10 so this is 10 10 10 lakh 10 lakh Rupees falls in the 30% slab 30% of 10 lakhs is Say it With Me 3 lakhs LH simple right 10 lakh salary 30% tax slab taxes 3 LS B gut so let's understand how this Works basically you have to stop thinking of this as slabs you have to start thinking of them as buckets so yeah bucket Bal bucket so what we'll do is whatever the 10 lakh Rupees is in this example three of it goes into 0% to isit tax is zero perfect now let's say 1 2 3 4 five laks goes into the 10% bucket so 10% of 5 lakhs is 50,000 50 it is 10% but we still have this left this goes into the so now you tell me 10% of 5 laks is 50,000 and 30% of 2 lakhs is 60,000 so can you add that up 1 lak 10,000 so 1 110,000 is the tax that you're paying not 3 laks like we originally said so this is how money is actually distributed and that's what tax slabs mean how did you distribute the money sir I want to I mean h Hanah see so do you think I can distribute it according to what I feel like yes you just did okay fair point but very simply the government gives us tax slabs which we're calling buckets and based on those slabs so 1 to five lakhs will there'll be a slab 5 to 7 there'll be a slab and you can put that amount in those slabs to find out what your effective tax rate is going to be oh that has been divided or decided already decided by the government those are the tax slabs I'm sure you've seen it nox seen those slabs right but there's a small change over here now this was the tax we just did which was 1 110,000 but what if you want to reduce this tax liability 1 10,000 is still some money know come on you can guess no tax funds tax funds investment investment insurance so the government has prescribed ways that you can take out some money put it into the economy can you flip that for me which we call deductions I can put it deductions one question sir yes is there a way that this does not go there and this comes here and which you'll buy sneakers for yes so this is the good question no no har this goes here prescribed by the government we won't talk about what deductions are but income red so before we talk about old and new regime I have to show you something can everyone move away please all right guys come back now we have a lot more tax brackets but it's the same concept I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 but what I'll do is let's do this with an example of 20 lakhs so I have 20 coins over here okay cool so as you can see we have different tax slabs we have 0% 5% 10% 15% 20% 30% why does the government do this if you earn less you pay a little less tax if you earn more you pay a little more tax so let's see here the first is 0 to three lakhs very simple now if you are earning 0 to three lakhs how much are you paying tax simple right I'll add this also now then we have three to six laks 5% 5% now we also have this 6 to9 I'm going to stop here for some time now so now I I know you asked about new regime old regime let's forget about that let's finish this in like 30 seconds ready we'll do it together who's good at maths you and you okay so only you both can answer okay let's go 30 seconds are we ready maths yes okay first one 2 3 tax zero zero 1 2 3 tax 15,000 very nice one two three six all right oh sorry 45,000 9 10 11 12 you know what this is right yes sir 12 to 15 laks 20% 60 and finally to zero bro and finally 15 lakhs plus where I'll put everything one thing I had to add over here there is a standard deduction that you can do on a income of 20 lakhs you can just remove 50,000 can someone tell me why standard stand standard want to deduction a non-standard high standard so after that is co then you can do a few other deductions and you can save tax and that's how the tax system works but I have a question still like which regime to choose the old one or the new one you basically want to know what regime you should choose yeah let's do two things first let's do a proper Excel sheet with your salary your salary so you know exactly which regime to choose and how much tax you have to pay and we'll do a checklist also cool let's go back after saving my money first yes yes your money yes V sir I have a better option ask sir I'll choose the old tax regime why so I'll take up all the deductions you'll take up all the deductions every single one of them become king correct and I'll save my taxes what are the what are the deductions ATC ATC D VD ATC sir ATC OCD PCD DVD so now you want to take the old regime because you want the deductions correct don't do this here's a simple way to think about it you take the deductions if you actually need it which means you shouldn't look at the deduction and say these deductions don't exist just to save tax it's there that to meet your personal finance goals the government helps you a little bit to save tax now old regime versus new regime let's do this here's a calculator where you can calculate your tax payable under the old tax regime and the new tax regime here is the annual income which in this case is 20 lakhs and 50% of your annual income is your basic salary which is about 10 lakh Rupees then we can see the exemptions exemptions are specific amounts that you can subtract from your your total income to reduce the amount of income that is taxed basically it helps lower your overall tax bill over here we'll add HRA so that will become reduced now since we don't have education allowance and children's hostel we'll ignore this and we'll use LTA 50,000 rupes for that and for reimbursements we'll leave that at zero so we can see here after deducting 250,000 our net salary is 163,000 now comes the deduction bit this is fun and just like exemptions deductions also help in lowering your taxable income so standard deduction of 50,000 is applicable to you have to see if you have home loan this person doesn't so I'll add a zero if you have any Investments up to 1.5 lakhs in these things We'll add 1.5 lakhs a lot of people do section ATC we leave everything else zero except We'll add NPS and we'll add health insurance premium perfect now we'll remove this from the net salary to get a taxable income of 133,000 and now you can see here that your tax payable is 29,90 rupe at this point you should probably pause and fill this up for yourself now let's look at the new tax regime over here you'll see of course the basic salary annual income gross salary are exactly the same let's move on to the exemptions area over here none of this is applicable so all of it is na so we can see our net salary is1 188,000 now let's look at the deduction we'll do the standard deduction and we'll remove 50,000 and we'll also do The NPS everything else is not applicable so now your taxable income is 178,000 so as per the new tax regime the tax payable is 2 l4330 now you have the tax liability for both regimes you can do a similar activity for your income to find out which regime is better for you you'll find this calculator in the description so go ahead click on file make a copy and fill this up for yourself don't you think it'll take too much time to select which regime is better based on all of these calculations that you have just um told I knew you would ask this therefore I have a ready reckoner right here on your screen and if you go to the description you can Pi it up and use it so in the First Column you have all the taxable income and if you look at the rows you have all the deduction and basically if you map out where you are you'll find out if you should pick the old regime or you could pick the new regime simple also guys here's a secret that no one's told you the last Daye to file taxes is 31st July but that's not true the last date is today file your taxes as fast as you can because 30th and then they do whatever they don't get a good deal because they don't have time so what did you learn today I'll tell you later debt and taxes will always happen you have to pay them so don't worry focus on earning more hope you found this episode interesting and that's very dark but do like and subscribe say something in the comments below see you in the next episode I not take up all of the deductions I'll fix up my personal finances first and if there's any provision left to take up H if there's [Music] anyu animator give the [Music] [Laughter] answer not pay any tax death and taxes will always happen so B dark such",

this huh all of these problems we will not declare and your premium will reduce and affordable can are you happy yeah this is fine H this is fine so all you have to do is sign over here I'll start the process wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait why are you getting don't declare it guys something went wrong over here and I think the entire industry is messed up so today we have and in true the influencing style we talk about the good the bad the ugly and everything in between that you need to know about buying health insurance because these guys won't tell you all of this so let's get [Music] started we all know about health insurance right and we think we pay certain premium and after that we get all the money back if we go to the hospital but what you don't know is that you're paying a premium for say 10 lakh cover but with these simple tricks this 10 lakh can become 50 lakh and you probably not covered for all these things over here which you will also be covered so we'll get the lowest premium and maximum benefit let's start with trick number one the health insurance industry is been disrupted by new kinds of companies and these companies offer direct to customer plans where you get the lowest premium so because there is no middleman premium actually come isn't that amazing they also offer the lowest waiting periods on anything of the ailments giving you definitely a lot of benefit and third these companies offer everything digitally so with the power of Technology you have the entire insurance agent in your hand and you have all the power because you know Tech and Tech is amazing prati prati here's the thing right lowest premiums don't always make the most sense because sometimes what tends to happens is insurance companies will price their premiums at rock bottom prices and then sell the plan to a bunch of people and then realize that it's not sustainable for them to actually run this way so at some point when they figure that they're losing more money than they're making they will automatically wake up one day and say listen I have to change your premium structure completely which means now instead of paying 10,000 in premiums over night you may be asked to pay 25,000 in premiums which means that then you have to find a different provider and if you can't find a different provider then you're essentially screwed no no but this is not possible no once I've got a premium signed a contract it's locked how can they change the premium it's not actually locked with health insurance premiums keep changing every year it could change because of inflation it could change because the insurance is currently running into a loss also it could change because of age bands because you've grown older so it's not like life insurance at all where you get a fixed premium throughout your tenure here the premium keeps changing every year and sometimes it can come as a bit of a surprise but but low waiting period to hog I mean I don't have to wait as long yes but then again if they're promising low or zero waiting periods there could also be another catch wherein even if you have the mildest disease the insurance company May simply reject the application and ask you to go to a different insurer so it doesn't always mean that low waiting periods means application guaranteed so okay fine I don't think this is that important so let's move to trick number two which is you know when you go to a hospital and you get hospitalized the insurance will cover that cost but what if you just visit a doctor which is OPD out patient services over here the cost is Bor by um your wallet so if you get a plan which covers this you have no issues an insurance company can actually cover you visiting a doctor isn't that amazing there's also maternity to of you are married and you might have a kid easily will be one lakh could be 2 lakhs also the insurance provider will cover that as well so look at these two plans over here that I have for you covering it's I understand that OPD plans and maternity plans look like great on paper because if you are married and you're planning on having kids to and OPD to is something that everybody visits right everybody visits a doctor but there is a catch the first catch is that OPD expenses aren't like hospitalization expenses just because you have a 10 lakh cover doesn't mean you'll get 10 lakh for OPD expenses also because insurance companies and their policies will cap the expenses to a certain limit usually it will be around 5 to 10,000 and even if they provide a cap that is higher then insurance companies will simply increase their premiums by the same amount so if you get a regular plan for 10,000 you'll get a plan with OPD for 15,000 with a 5,000 OPD expense also maternity expenses while it is a great benefit to have also come with some caveats for one it is slightly more expensive than regular plans and also you have to be enrolled in a family floater plan with a spouse and you have to wait for 3 to 4 years before most insurance companies will even pay out the claim which means you have to do some meticulous Family Planning before you make sh is very negative person yeah I don't think this is true but I have another trick of my sleeve trick number three now guys look your job is to find a great company or startup providing you the best healthare clear this up in the interview because Healthcare cover is very important in today's day and age and the healthcare will cover like you said you can't say G maternity it will will cover all these other benefits as well so you will actually save Insurance all my friends have a separate insurance cover for health no need I work in such a good company it gives me all the benefits so here if you multiply this by 10 years look how much savings you are doing there is a cat most corporate plans also come with limits for instance they may say we'll only cover you up to 5 lakhs and not 10 or 15 or 20 lakhs the amount that you may actually need including your family members also there's another problem see corporate plans only work until you are with the corporate so if you choose to quit or unfortunately contracted with a critical illness and you have to leave work then ultimately you won't have a policy and you can't buy a new policy either because at that point in time insurance companies will reject you because you're a high-risk individual unfortunately so you won't have cover and you won't be able to pay for those expenses so it actually makes sense to have a retail plan just in case that your corporate plan doesn't go through in these rare events actually I know that we should all have insurance I just you know mix up it's fine it's fine so here is Trick number four okay very simple when you're buying an insurance plan you have to make sure that this 10 lakh Insurance can actually become 50 LS let me explain how first you get some kind of benefit right the first benefit is called unlimited restoration now imagine your summer short is 10 lakhs 5 lakhs you've covered and you've taken the claim and you spent it you it goes back to 10 lakh Rupees then again you go again you take a claim again you spend say 6 lakh again it goes back to 10 lakh so restore right this is this is pretty amazing there's also another benefit and that benefit is called No claim bonus suppose you did not use it to unlimited restoration huani so what will happen is next year because you didn't take a claim that 10 lakhs will become 15 and that 15 will become 20 and at 20 will become 37 37 become 50 and you you just make think what are you saying look features are important in a plan just say unlimited restoration no claim bonus it makes sense to have it but the first thing you have to make sure is the insurer will first pass your claim even if it's for one or two lakhs more often than not what happens is once the claim goes beyond one or two lakhs immediately the insurer will say he there is a problem actually I'm not going to pay the claim because there is a reasonable and customer Clause now what is the reasonable and customary Clause well they'll say you something like this they'll tell you that I will only pay for expenses that are deemed reasonable and customary according to me so if your doctor bills you for 80,000 and insurance company doesn't think it's a fair price then they will not even pay your claims forget about restoration how do they decide 80,000 is fair or not I mean this is not this at their discretion they don't have to decide they've wrote it in the contract and they say yeah you signed it and they'll say simply no go fight it fight your ca what is problem so this brings us to trick number five and I'm sure problem where are you from uh I'm actually from Mangalore M but I currently stay in Bangalore and your Adar says what I'm actually from Mangalore because the address is from Mangalore I already knew this guys so there are different zones divided by insurance companies throughout the country certain zones actually demand a lesser premium and certain zones are higher premium did you know that so Mangalore will be actually cheaper so what you can do is take your Adar card show it to the insurance provider and you will have a difference of Premium because you're from Mangalore and you'll save money pratique I knew this actually the problem with that argument however is that once you make sure you tell the insurer that you from Mangalore then they'll expect you to make a claim in Mangalore accidentally if you travel somewhere in India once a claim happens in say amdad or Delhi maybe they'll pass a claim but then again it's at their discretion however consistently if you're making claims in Bangalore because I'm residing in Bangalore then the insurance company will most likely ask me to co-pay a part of the bill which means if my bill adds up to 1 lakh they'll say 20,000 you pay out of pocket because you're technically kind of cheating me since you're from Mangalore and then you're availing services in Bangalore where prices of Hospital providers are generally higher so Pik do you have any more tricks up your sleeve no I don't but what I do have is a checklist which both and I will talk about the first checklist to choose any insurance provider is looking at the network hospital now this is simply a list of hospitals covered by the insurance provider which is in a cashless facility so it's a good practice for you to actually figure out whether that list contains the hospital you frequent and then there's room rent restrictions now when you read the policy document it will say single AC private room sounds amazing but it may not be a good thing what you want is this should say no room rent restrictions and finally speaking of how to pick between insurers make sure that you check out the claim settlement ratio uh number above 90% is generally good when it comes to health insurance and things like volume of complaints because more complaints often means more trouble however make sure you differentiate between a general insurance company and a standalone health insurance company because a standalone health insurance company only does health insurance which means that they will see a higher volume of complaints because of the kind of business that they do whereas a general insurance company will do motor will do travel will do health and so their volume of complaints may not be as high because the line of business does not invite as many complaints so you have to make that distinctions and finally always look at the track record of an insurer just because an insurer posted great claim settlement numbers for one year doesn't mean that they did it historically as well so it's generally a good practice to look at the claim settlement numbers and other ratios for at least two or three years before you make a decision and generally speaking a longer track record often makes more sense because you want your insurer to stick around when you eventually make a claim you can find a lot of this information on the insurer's website itself and the ird's website too we've put in links in the description so do check it out and finally insurance is one of those things where you actually need some sort of help to actually do this now these were just some of the nuances imagine that 40 page contract there's an if and but after every sentence you need someone on your side a consultant or an adviser who can fight for you because that contract is designed so the insurer doesn't have to pay money out to you and for this a middleman actually really really helps so not just any middleman ideally should have an adviser and shth has flown all the way from Bangalore over here to the studio because he really does a good job in understanding how the insurance Market works so I think you should check out ditto go over there book a free consultation with an adviser and just understand understand the nuances of this so if you thought this was useful give a like And subscribe and see you in the next episode oh I I I'm breaking character no the catch is very [Music] simple I will I will give you a use case it's a very there's also another benefit and that benefit is called No claim Rus and that that's [Laughter] for",

    "transcript_full": "sir I am going to be rich yeah check this out see I have started investing With Sips the kager is too good I also have four no five mutual funds all Diversified all Diversified and also I just recently bought a life insurance that is also going to give me good returns see the problem is I have another big problem what's the problem the markets are at alltime high now what do you think I should do I think yes you should yeah it this is a horrible plan who told you to look at cagr when you're doing sip no no why did you buy this when you're supposed to buy that an endowment plan for insurance that's what and all your mutual funds look completely wrong so what do you mean diversify sips so what's the problem actually you're right the fault is mine and you're probably thinking abishek has done a good job the problem is this most people who begin this is a great first step but I think you've oversimplified it a little bit and most people who start investing make these exact same mistakes I've seen a million times so in this episode let's fix this and talk about the biggest mistakes people make when they start investing for you and for you are you ready okay let's [Music] begin so let's start with the mutual fund investment yes abish you have five mutual funds how did you select these mutual funds simple I went to Google and I searched top five mutual funds to start investing in you searched for top five mutual funds correct on Google yes and you got the best returns funds yes the top returns yes and you invested in the top five that's what you said now diversify I didn't invest in just one I invested in all five okay let me explain yeah here's you did what does diversification mean invest in many mutual funds because if one fails so you get returns from another one good job okay so basically imagine that these poker chips are different stocks because it's easier to explain so you have these different stocks over here now let's suppose one of these stocks is say I won't take an Indian company's name because it'll be unfair uh let's say one of these stocks is Enron Enron is this American company which went to zero and this becomes uh red okay goes to zero okay would you have lost all of your wealth because of this no no right because you have multiple stocks and you have Diversified perfect now when you're investing mutual funds which is completely fine you want to make sure this is happening but what if I told you you invested in all these value funds and all of them are investing in the same companies which means you may have five mutual funds but actually they're investing in the same same set of companies and you're not actually Diversified you're actually concentrated because they're the same kind of mutual fund it could look like this also this is not diversification no because they're all the same kind so one way to do it is to do large cap mid cap small cap so there's some diversification there another zoomed out way is you diversify between asset classes in the end all of this is equity right so you could probably add say like gold somewhere you could probably add say what else insurance in every debt I'll come to that you said Insurance what I said debt if you know what he messed up comment and you could add say another asset class over here real estate real estate and this is completely fine but don't do it just within Equity so what you've done is diversification actually is not diversification so you got it so top five mutual funds know and you know why you should pick up mutual fund based on returns we made a video on it check it out okay so tell me one thing what do you mean my diversification then I'll tell you in a simple simple way okay if someone doesn't want to put any effort in figuring this out a simple way is to just buy an index like a nifty50 index or any kind of index that index will cover all of these problems and you just think really long term 10 15 years and you'll do fine but if I want to put effort then the other yeah the other side is where you put a lot of effort right so that effort requires you to research Industries research companies and make concentrated bets 15 to 20 companies portfolio this is not easy to do because you have to understand the markets and if you want to begin your journey Varsity is a fantastic place to begin go to

a portfolio that's where you can create outsize returns out what outside really high returns over a long period of time like Warren Buffett or actually Bill Gates is a better example oh Microsoft Bill Gates made all of his money from stocks which stock Microsoft correct and another company Burkshire hatway okay ohle so they he invested in these stocks and these stocks did really well of course he was also the founder of Microsoft but think what a concentrated bet that was on just one stock and I think yesterday dude uh that guy in the office he came to me and he said I've been watching this series I love it and I have bought 50 stocks 50 stocks that's the other side of the spectrum he's over Diversified so please don't over diversify because you'll get mediocre returns and 50 stocks I don't know if that makes sense especially if you're picking them it probably won't do well so if you're new to markets index is simple if you want to spend many years understanding markets creating a 15 20 stock portfolio is probably better what if someone has 35 stocks 35 sounds like a bit much so I think you should fix that how do you know how well you're doing cagr so you look at cagr to check whether the stocks are doing well correct that's what you taught me no no no dude this is the second problem don't look at cagr it might not be right for you you have to look at irr or xir what let me explain here we have year one J you make 10% in the market Good Year Rich very nice next year you make another 10% let's make this equal let's assume it's equal 10% again how are you doing as an investor smart and Rich nice let's say the next year it's - 5% and the year after that again is - 5% leaves me with 10% still Rich what do you think is your overall return 7% okay M 7% actually it will be in the lower single digits and the reason is that time has gone by year one year two year three year four these two years didn't earn anything and this did so the average return is much much lower than what you think balance okay it is how much money you earn through time and it's an average that's why it's compounded annual growth growth rate the cagr but you had put in initial sum at the start of the year and you didn't do anything you just held on cagr works well for this okay but is this how you really invest no I have sips you have systematic investment plan and you're investing every month month that means you're not investing months a year you're investing 12 times a year correct and another 12 times a year and another 12 times and another 12 times isn't that a little confusing think about it in the first year you will put money 12 times and the value of nifty is going up and down also so there is inflow there is outflow your returns will not be cagr correct are sir what will it be you tell me so a fancy way of actually calculating that is irr internal rate of return if you want to know how well your sip is returning not the market then you have to use the IR metric not the cagr it's also called the xir when you do it on x well the formula is xir if your sip is 10,000 rupes a month every month versus you invest 1.2 lakhs in one shot which is 10,000 * 12 the returns will very different because you spread out the money right so that depends on the market movements as well and you are putting money taking money out so that changes your return profile so the metric is irr not cagr so how much return will you get xir I am fine with everything see if there is anything left now to I think my life insurance will give me that return give me returns to I think your life insurance will give you returns exactly on what on uh they'll also invest my money in the markets now you've taken one of those plans yes one of those ones yes life cover see if something happens to me my parents will get amount right and not so I'll get returns with the money that these guys are investing perf you want to buy that insurance no please no my God hry so very simply a life insurance is supposed to take care of your family and an investment product is supposed to give you returns right don't Club them you know why all life insurance plans which club Investments give suboptimal returns and don't give you a great cover also no no just just trust me on this one so basically the returns are from stock markets from fds from different instruments and insurance is for your loved ones in case something happens to you so they don't give me returns they are not supposed to they're supposed to give you peace of mind these are different things got it okay okay so separate it I also wanted to show you something over here I saw this ad recently cool check this out read it small cap returns nice small cap returns returns will it be nice yes but with high risk and it's investing in what small caps and hopefully it grows hopefully the interesting thing is this ad is actually not about a mutual fund at all it's actually an insurance plan disguised as a mutual fund product this poster seems a little misleading because an insurance is a completely different thing and a mutual fund is a completely different thing how do they bring them together there is a product for this but it's actually a suboptimal product this is a classic case of Miss selling where they try to bring in returns with an insurance I have a question is is that a problem what happens if you mix insurance with your Investments it's a good point so one once they're mixed you don't know whether the premium is going to the insurance or it's being invested second the commission on these is so large that actually what is being reduced is not good for your Investments compounding so the costs are very high and you can't see them it's not very transparent if you look at any Benchmark returns like Nifty Etc versus say uh ulip it will always be much much lower without question and there's another thing in a ulip you can't stop the premium you're paying you know why why if you stop it then life insurance no insurance gone that's what insurance is right if you don't pay the premium it's not valid but in a mutual fund it's not a payment it's an investment you can stop it when you feel like oh and I'll get my money yes I mean you shouldn't but you can does that make sense so just separate the two they're two different products different purpose pures sir I got it I'll just do I'll just do one thing wait wait I'll just separate the investing my investments and the mutual fund sorry investment and here's the thing right I think the entire industry is giving us so many options to make our life easier but it's actually confused the heck out of us which is why this channel exists to demystify money in a funfilled way I wish we could all meet each other I should tell this to my friends no they're all in Bangalore no yes maybe you should visit the Bangalore Fest called the zero 1 Fest so you should come to the 01 Fest which is happening in Bangalore on

    "transcript_full": "the crazy thing about our generation is that we are earning more than our parents but this generation is the poorest we spoke to 12 young people between 23 and 27 across six cities to understand their money decision aesthetic items that I buy Kangal in the last week of my month they definitely trick me I kept saving I am actually guilty of impulse shopping we compiled pattern matched and found four stories which were similar to all of them and I'm sure it's also similar to you before I tell you about these four money decisions I want to tell you about CA our sixth interview her day starts with the coffee machine and the only time she breaks her resting Poker Face is when she gets a message on the first of every single month but when she joined her first job she carried a Heart full of dreams and a desire to give her parents their own home but today she can't imagine owning the house anymore because she's buried in a debt of 11 lakh rupees this isn't ca's story in fact this is happening to all of us and we don't even know it it starts with one misdirection then the next then the next then the next and before we know it our life is completely changed actually let me tell you about the first decision in 2014 I took a flight from Delhi to Bombay for a client that I was trying to work with now when I landed at the airport and took a taxi to the meeting I saw ads you know those big Holdings everywhere and they all had nike airs on them so this one ad and the smartest people in the world convince me to buy the product sounds like normal marketing but you know what the billboard has changed the billboard is now on your phone and the crazy thing is that this is data bag which means they can show an ad measure the number of Impressions see how many people clicked and also measure how many people converted and run multiple studies on this ad with different copy and different design to find which one is the most addictive and which one converts the most which means you are a test subject and the smartest people in the world are figuring out how to sell something to you every hour every day 550 CR internet users and 520 social media us user Lab Rats who can be Quantified so you can buy so you can pay so you become poorer this is actually a science it's called the stimulus and response Theory which means that people have a certain desire which you stimulate using certain form of ads copy and visual Graphics Des purchas validation rep and then they respond with likes and shares which is how advertisers know that something is needed and to fill that Gap they actually run those ads to sell you an object and this creates habitual consumerism which means you keep buying stuff even though you don't need it because just happened and our parents actually had a great solution to this seeing an ad on a newspaper py the page hearing something in the radio zip Z zip next Channel you can always flip the channel on the TV as well but for us the internet has actually brought content and together remember there was always a popular group at least I had one and these were the coolest kids they were good at basketball they didn't care about anything and we all have these groups back in school that we loved and we would sort of imitate them or at least want to be like them but back then there was no Instagram today the most popular kids in schools don't have 10 or 20 followers on the internet they have a million which means everyone wants to talk like them have tattoos like them work out like them have friends like them have clothes like them and if they're wearing something from a brand you want to buy it this report from BCG talks about how jenzi uses influencers as search engines to find out what's cool what's not what's hot what's cold what should they be wearing what should they be watching and what's the new trend and because of this influencer culture the modern billboard isn't a billboard or an ad it's a freaking selfie according to Harvard Business Review 75 % of Brands now have a dedicated budget for influencer marketing but why why would they spend money on influencer marketing it's because of originality when someone opens up a piece of chocolate casually and says he loves this chocolate and you love this person you are now imitating the most popular kid in school it's the best way to sell and C2 fell into this Vicious Circle an aesthetic reel here a beautiful product there and a favorite influencer saying check this out two clicks but the problem isn't with the Creator or even the content it's actually how easy it is to pay in other words I'll pay later UPI is the most popular between ages 18 to 30 because of convenience people think because it's easy they'll use UPI but because it's easy they'll actually spend more you know people who are spend thrifts they should not be using UPI because it's just too easy actually that's not that bad because so you think this would stop the downfall right if you don't have it you can't spend it right nope Innovations in fintech have brought to you buy now pay later and this used to happen in the past two you would go to your local kirana store and you know you have kundan Bay over there and you would buy something and you'd say B I'll give the money later and this was okay until a point where it cost 500 600 rupees and he said said ba please give my money time you owe me 500 rupees this way you wouldn't overspend and he wouldn't give too much credit and you'd still be friends and there'd be no interest but now this exact same relationship on the Internet is on steroids here you don't know kundan bayya and your total outstanding amount could be 50,000 Rupees and maybe you don't even have that muchy most of the iPhones in the country are on credit the interesting thing about bnpl is that you can see the transactions Rising so the number of transactions is going up you can also see that the amount in value is also going up and most of it is coming from the younger generation it feels absolutely okay because everyone around you is doing it 40% of jenz taking debt have unsustainable levels which means they can't actually pay it added to that we also have the growth of credit cards primarily fueled by Millennials and genzies you know when we were kids we'd sit down in the drawing room and listen to Dad he and Mom would debate about what the next thing we should buy is it going to be a study table or is it going to be a brand new cooler and we had to choose only one and after all of this debate we would finally decide and the next month we would go and actually purchase that item there was so much of planning and effort that went into that one item which would come into our home but now CA can look into her phone and decide absolutely Al loone whether she should use a 3-month interest free loan or a six-month with interest loan for her fifth purchase of month and that's where we saw a shift from PES B to loan [Music] P what's the inflation in India 6% right you've probably heard this in the news or from the papers but what if I told you this is completely wrong where it comes to your life's context let me explain the government calculates inflation by simply looking at this basket over here which has different items now it tracks the prices of these items over a period of time and the difference on this chart gives you a percentage increase in this case it's around 6% but but do you really think that all of these items went up by 6% for you I really mean you actually open last year's grocery list and this year's list with all these items is it actually 6% it won't be because all of us are in a trap of our Ambitions we all want to lead a better life and you guys don't belong to this chart over here you guys belong to the sexier chart but this one the OT the ordering all of the nice things in life are here and so is your de this is called lifestyle inflation and lifestyle inflation is the real inflation you should be tracking and before I tell you the fourth Point think about ca for a moment because her story is all of our stories it starts completely normal and harmless you buy a few things here and there there's a shopping spree maybe you go out and maybe you have a meal or two or three maybe a little too often C's 11 lakh debt is basically convenience spends plus impulse buys plus lifestyle upgrades she definitely can't afford fueled by credit multiplied by time the fourth money decision is actually a challenge every generation has a challenge that is presented before them that seems really really tough to surmount and for us it's not a war or disease or something that can really be bad for an entire life or family it's actually the abundance of everything we have access to unlimited knowledge skills money and maybe even the job that you always wanted but the problem in the abundance economy is that you get totally confused and other people Society apps tell you what you need to do to be happy but the real secret here is if you can figure out what you want in life and you exactly go after that without any outside influence you my friend would have completed the challenge your formula and the right hand side of it would say happiness cuz that's all that really matters",

    "transcript_full": "sir fire fire what's fire financial Independence and retire early dude what's wrong with your generation sometimes you're fire your Henry you dink dad sir you're old so basically reement 65 why do we Indians have early milestones for everything I want to buy a car right now I want to buy a plane right now I want to buy a house right now but retirement 65 P are you kidding me she want that to be earlier of course and how you going to do that let me tell [Music] you before you tell me your grand plan why do you want to even retire early sir times have changed so today we have this new Cutting Edge Health Tech and because of that the average life expectancy maybe has increased from 60 to 72 so that means people can live healthy longer but okay and also our generation is shifting from joint family to nuclear family so basically I have to take care of myself and my partner okay and that's why you want to retire early correct and what will you do with all this time you think scrolling on reels for the rest of your life you'll actually enjoy that I don't scroll reels all the day first of all and basically retirement does not mean me not working at all I have plans I want to do scuba diving I want to do skydiving probably sipping some pina coladas maybe on a decent Beach and after all of this I want to continue working so basically I want to do everything that I like without thinking about money like I like working for 01 Channel subscribe right now even if you give my retirement fund right now me yeah you I would love to continue making these videos for our Channel and hence F I mean so the core idea is simple you earn and invest and then you plan your cool comfortable life going forward okay hold up so this me me you will work till 40 correct save till 40 not overspend and instead of saving you'll invest that money so after 40 you can live a peaceful life lying on the beach you know I think uh this is a very internet specific Trend because I mean when I was your age and that was not too long ago we didn't call it fire tire and all of these fancy things it was just live below your means and invest that's it it was just work hard of course there was a work hard part as well but I think like I said it's internet specific Trend and for other countries it may work but Indians have always thought about savings as a culture it's not like it's part of being Indian sir what if fire achieve I am a total I'll be useless like total [Music] failure I think you romanticized this a little too much hey tell me does everyone in your generation think about this fire thing a lot hey Nish can we ask around people in the office all these genzi folks what what they think about fire have you heard of fire fire a AA Fire I have not heard about it yeah I've heard it a couple of times before uh no I don't think so like tell me about it like what's it I'm talking about financial Independence retirement early uhhuh do you think an average income earner can achieve fire so if I talk about me I don't think so because you know at My AG so inv not even sure about the savings so yeah mean retirement picture yeah I don't know much about it and I don't think I can achieve it as well okay why do you think so it's very difficult you have to save aggressively invest aggressively have you planned for your retirement I am just 23 you know Financial Independence is for the wealthy people not just middle class so we'll have to work till 60 70 years of age you have to do fire how many you do it feel uh I'll have to work a lot I'll have to live frugally once I finally attain Financial Independence I'll relax and I'll pursue my hobbies I guess that is the goal right to exit the 9 to5 grind oh my God what are all these kids saying actually I'm not that surprised um one thing I noticed from these guys is that they're saying that this is only for the wealthy rich people can only do it I think so this is not true actually right like we've spoken about this so many times you can simply start with with a monthly sip even if it's 1,000 rupees which is a lot by the way over many years it'll actually compound I think the tougher thing to do is starting all of us think that we need to start with a sip of 20 30,000 rupees this is simply not true so it's not about where you are today it's where you can be 10 or 15 years from now so retirement planning is actually a thing and we can actually find a number but how it's a simple calculation right so I have a retirement tracker let me open it up all you have to do is when did you start working put in your full name put in your age uh assume there's your monthly income a monthly expense put in what salary increment you think you can get and you'll also put expense in increment I would suggest a little more than inflation because your expenses do increase as you get older correct now all of these are assumptions and it's fine it's to just get an idea once you fill this all out you can figure out how much runway you have what's Runway Runway is if you stop working how many years of money you actually have based on the savings you have so in this case that I've put over here you're getting about 6 years but if I shift to the next tab that's Returns what you could do is assume a return percentage let's suppose you invested in an index fund okay and left it let's say it was a sip and you did it over 10 15 years assume a certain return 12 13% is a good ballpark but let's take a lower return let's say 10% and if I put 10 you can see my Runway has gone from my savings 6 years to 13 years it's not bad right double a simple hack is this so let's suppose you started with a regular sip of 10,000 rupes a month example and do you think your salary will increase over the next 5 years do you it will what you can do is you can instead of just doing 10,000 every month and then showing the compounding on your calculator you can do something called a step up investment you know what that is what what's that where you can step up the Sip you can increase the Sip is fancy of saying but the results are amazing right so if you just did a regular sip over 15 years you would have 24 lakh rupees but if you did the step up it would be almost 45 and a half half lakh rupees it's more than double more than double but remember the power is not coming just from the investment it's coming from time the longer you do it the better so you have time on your side I'm old I'm old then what's the advantage of you being young okay to uh if I don't spend my money do you think I would cut short my duration from 25 years to 10 years I won't buy my Jordans I won't buy my Apple watch hold on hold on hold on I I noticed this with these guys as well you must live this deprived lifestyle style to actually be wealthy and free in the future this is not true dude I mean life is about experiences what if at the age of 70 you have a lot of money and have not done the stuff that requires energy but not a lot of cash like going to a concert like going to a nice place so imagine if you're not cash Rich you're energy rich you can actually go out and do all of that I don't think you should deprive yourself of that so you think I can attend a Fest without spending any money I might know a place but sir in the video these people are saying fire means never working again I don't agree with that yeah uh I think so too but there's a chicken and egg problem over here so we have two situations one we want to work and earn enough so that we don't have to work but want to continue working on something we like correct correct now the chicken and egg problem is this you are unlikely to have a really large outcome in your job unless you really like your job do you think vat kohle does not enjoy playing Cricket at home on Saturday or Sunday just to relax I don't think so does he think oh my God this is work I don't want to look at a bat anymore actually there are a lot of verat kohes in the world think about the best musicians the best actors the best people in their field likely love what they do so if you don't like your job I think you like your job course the likeliness of you doing well financially is higher if you've actually done that and you Achieve Financial Freedom you will not stop working because you love that job you will actually double triple down so this never working again concept doesn't make sense also one thing about this fire trend on the internet dude it's not a Dar step that everyone can copy the same step and it's the same personal finance is personal to everyone and everyone's J is different for example one person could say thatth like you your salary will increase over time but your lifestyle will not you'll maintain the lifestyle you will not increase your lifestyle and therefore your savings increase every year increase as in don't I don't have to buy Jordans correct so you maintain your life lifestyle lifestyle inflation and whatever's left you investing saving so that that's one way another way is deprivation you cut down everything right you move to a smaller apartment you don't get a car everything you can do to reduce your expenses so that you can maximize your savings I'm not sure about this but if it works for someone great but unlikely the person is going to enjoy this process cuz we want to enjoy our life as we go by it but okay it is one method so it's called minimalism I think not deprivation okay fair enough which is why personal finance personally I don't like it but you you may and minimalism yeah it's a movement so okay that's another way there's probably the final way where very early in your life you try to do as much saving as you can enough for your retirement the sort of Coast through life you just enjoy um because you have saved up very early in the first 10 years say it's from 20 to 30 or 20 to 35 you create aggressively that Corpus and then you sort of Coast through life that's also another way but the problem with this is as soon as you reduce time at least in the world of investment you have now added this one variable which means everything I want money faster that's what everyone thinks you Google this right and you will find people saying make one CR in 10 years by doing X invest in this by doing why and that's where all Financial scams and problems start because let's face it even you want that money in 10 years don't lie of course you do right right it's tough and because of that greed um people online may say five 10 years get 1 CR here's the formula and they may use a calculator like this one let me show you look at this so in this calculator we are getting to 1 CR and this proper calculation okay looks real right right it makes sense right it's fair no problem correct period yes but look at the expected returns 15 15 I mean I can make this 18% and look even nicer but what's a fairer number 10% yeah 10 so cagr has been 12 15% for Nifty but assume 10 so by doing these things you're adding pressure and I think Charlie manger said the way to a happy life is low expectations oh that's so in short the internet will lie to you because the internet wants to show how you can make money quickly don't believe it these are tall claims we have an entire series called de influencing where we de influenc you and tell you the truth about what's happening with your world of money check that out subscribe and if not fire do fi Financial Independence normal investing long-term best right sir you know what's going to give me Financial Independence what you subscribing to this Channel right now because that will lead to incentive bonus sir Feb appraisal uh want to talk right right now no see that look at that that thanks

nowhere what will you do in life we have to get into I IM focus on studies nothing else a few years later papa papa I want to show you something I have finally graduated Papa see my degree graduated this is great news congratulations bet very proud of you start the cat coaching immediately Sharm is 5 days already in it Papa I don't want to do MBA papa no cat nothing Papa you don't want to do MBA means what Pap see this see this I am not listening to any of this nonsense you are going to I am I don't care Papa I have take these photographs see how is it what will I tell everyone better my son takes photos this is not a job this is a hobby leave it as a hobby go attend cat Papa cat competition you know 21 IMS 5,000 seats and CTC packages I don't want to get who is telling you all of this this is all nonsense Papa this is my passion Papa I want to pursue my passion be [Music] practical something was definitely wrong with this conversation I mean MBA I know people love but think about it there are 2.8 lakh cat applicants every single year and increasing there are 21 I IMS with just 5,000 seats and don't get me started with the tens of lacks of rupees these guys charge for that MBA and that fat package you see the CTC it's not even true you know what we should actually do an entire episode on this so this time let's de influence NBAs in India we'll talk talk about the good the bad cuz these guys certainly won't so let's get [Music] started MBA MBA mbas it's everywhere parents talking about it Society talking about it the newspaper talking about it and kids talking about it and it's not their fault they were over 2.8 lakh people people appearing for the cat exam you know the exam to get into an MBA college there are over 5,000 B schools out there the cost of an MBA is 5 lakhs to 25 lakhs and there are only 21 iims so we don't have a problem with mbas mbas are just fine the problem is the expectation Society has you have and what your parents have so let's de influence that part let's start with i IMS the country's favorite a b c but we also have 21 total IM IMS available for you to get in but remember there were 2.8 lakh candidates appearing for the cat exam and there are only 5,000 seats think about this for a moment so many aspirants and so little seats just 5,100 and this is equivalent to 1.77% let that sink in for a bit and if this wasn't enough this includes the baby I IMS but if you remove all the baby I IMS and focus on the top I IMS well the seats represent only less than 1% I want you to think about this for a moment all I IMS are not the same what matters is the word that follows after the word I IM am so recruiters may know that I am Ahmedabad is very prestigious so is Bangalore so is Kolkata so are a bunch of others but we also have baby I IMS and these baby I IMS are well babies it's new The Faculty is different the alumni is different the network isn't the same it's not the same as the old iims which means that if the recruiters know that the baby I IMS are not as good that brings implications to you because you have come with the expectation of a high salary nice company great place to start as a position it may not be true when you're thinking about these new I IMS now if the quality of these new baby IMS is not as good relative to the older ones seats but there are more people registering for the exams in fact the number is 3.3 lakh people registered and this represents a 30% increase from the previous year this means the aspirational value of an MBA from I is increasing but the seats are still low so what do you think is going to happen happen but not to worry we have private colleges to the rescue there are 5,000 amazing MBA colleges in the country now let's see 5,000 colleges we have 21 really good IMS perfect let's include some 100 really nice private colleges as well 120 let's round off this number to 200 good places you can go what about the rest 4,800 colleges should you get an MBA just for the tag from any college obviously not right every College won't be good I'm guessing there'll only be between 100 to 200 really good places to go and I'm being overly conservative over here the chances of a good MBA college is likely to be much less than 50 colleges out there and like any product let's call MBA a product for this conversation when you have varying degrees of quality you also have varying degrees of prices but something's wrong with the the MBA product Market in India every MBA college seems to charge roughly the same fees whether you've heard of it or not how can there not be differences in the prices of the fees if we have so many colleges out there hm maybe the consumer is not making a logical decision maybe the consumer just wants the MBA tag maybe these colleges are claiming things which obviously aren't true and because we really have a high aspirational value you we want to get in and that's why the prices never went down they just charged really high for a crappy education and if you don't believe me I have some data to prove it and I'll read it out for you the fee for a 2-year MBA program at many of the second tier institutes can go up to 16 lakh rupees while only a handful less than 5% get offers that exceed 8 lakh rupees which means people are actually making much less than that and spending a lot of money just because of the MBA tag does this make any sense I don't think so the problem doesn't end there imagine a student getting a 5 lak rupee offer who has to live pay for his living expenses his rent living moving Transportation etc etc and he has a loan to pay who is going to Chuka the loan with compound interest moving against himself it will take him years to actually pay this back the fees is high let's digest it somehow the thing that is unable to be digested is this less than 7% of NBA graduates are actually employable which means the thing that industry actually needs and the skills that they've been taught over the last 2 years doesn't seem to match in fact there are so many MBA graduates out there from all these different institutes that some of them are earning 10 20 30,000 rupees a month after spending spending lacks of rupees on that NBA degree which comes to the conclusion that maybe people are doing it just for the tag and not for the actual skills MBA was designed to do or there's an over supply of too many MBA graduates and the quality is gone and employers don't know who's good or bad and therefore the salary expectation that you have versus what the employers will give there is a very big mismatch now let's talk about the demand side of NBA so from the employer perspective what is the data SA ET did an interesting story where they spoke to multiple heads of HR asking them what do they think about employability and mbas their answer was interesting because they said mbas are generalized skills with a little bit of specialization but the guys with actual specialization in a niche that they've mastered are way ahead of the curve when compared to a generalized MBA even if it has some kind of specialization because it's not good enough enough for the industry yet which means Hands-On project building skills stuff to actually know what's happening today is far more important than just knowing abbreviations full forms and fancy words then we did a search on LinkedIn monster noer and a bunch of other job sites to find the word MBA as a minimum qualification for experience between 0o to six and the results were in the results were a 55% drop from 2023 versus 2022 now I understand generally in 2023 jobs were low but the White colar Market was down by only 25% compared this to NBA down 55% obviously something is wrong over here because it's declining it shouldn't be declining on the other side 3.3 lakh people aspirants have filled up registration forms to appear for cat which is a 30% increase so the demand demand is increasing the supply is decreasing hm why so guys we aren't against mbas we against people who don't understand what to expect from an MBA and have a mismatch saying they're going to make a lot of money and that brings me to our next Point High CTC and 100% placement As Told by the vested interest that is the college itself let's begin the college will say 100% placement look at this it'll give some nice fancy logos you you'll go online and see life at Google and get totally impressed and then imagine your beautiful life and obviously there is a huge pay package of 25 lakhs 50 lakhs to start off with by the way I think it's a good time for you to pause see this video on CTC versus expectation check it out and understand what CTC means sir I need to talk to you regarding something sir H tell me sir interview 65 lakh C which means 5.41 lakhs in sir I got only 1.36 lak sir bet but obviously I have a solution to this one simple solution go to Google right now type get job in Google Amazon top MBA guarantee and you will find these amazing posters these posters will give you colleges you've never heard of because they're a secret and once you get in you get all these obviously I'm lying none of this is true the problem is fake MBA colleges this is actually true the trouble is you're watching this video and you will never fall for it but less fortunate people who may be in your circle who may be less privileged than you will fall for it I mean this ad just looks fake right but a lot of people in fact most of India does not think it's fake it looks genuine to them because their numbers it's an ad there's a physical institution and his father and mother actually want to do the best for their child even though they can't afford it they'll do anything for the children humans are emotional and the child also wants to prove himself and he works really hard the problem with fake degrees is this one the college is low ranked two if it's not low ranked the college may be fake completely and not recognized by any Institute three every of the claim they make is actually fake so getting into Google Amazon was probably just the call center giving them 20 ,000 rupes a month that's an expectation mismatch why did they charge lacks of rupees for this this is totally scammy share this with a less fortunate person so they don't make a mistake I'm talking about the guards in your house your drivers the people near you so you can take care of them because if they're scammed they'll be paying emis for the next 20 years save them have you seen the movie Three Idiots we have faran on one side who actually wants to pursue photography but at some point in his life when was born he was told that he has to become an engineer there's nothing wrong with the parents or Society here but the way life is designed there is an autopilot mode you heard of autopilot mode autopilot mode is if you don't do anything about your job or what you want to do the world will decide for you because let's face it most of us don't know what the hell we're doing so they say after 12th you'll be completely fine College p and you'll be okay study hard and get good marks placement then things will be all right sh off midlife crisis so if you're taking a decision told by a parents or your friends that NBA is hot and you should do it know that that is the autopilot Choice the choice should always be yours not what people are telling you I hope you like this episode hit that like And subscribe put something nice in the comments 01 to change the industry by doing Finance in a fun way to help you in your career see you in the next episode something was definitely wrong [Laughter] there Papa to",

    "transcript_full": "sir sir sir I know where to invest I know how to invest but I'm left with zero money in my account what do you mean you're left with zero money wait look at all of these expenses that I've listed down right okay and after after this I'm left with zero it says insufficient balance hm why don't you put it all in expense tracker and make sure you don't spend all this money I know I knew you were going to say that I did but some I'm not able to follow I think I understand what the problem is you know I used to have this little Domino's coupon we used to cut out we used to physically go oh that's too old not that old I us to get this amazing Pizza it was fun and uh it was hard to actually spend and there was Cash how do you how do you apply a coupon now copy the code and paste it yeah and we had to do all of that actually you know what everything we've learned about money storing money in a piggy bank Etc is no longer valid because the world has changed and the way we spend has changed so in this episode why don't we talk about the spending habits of of this generation for you and for people like me and what we can do to well not be like [Music] abishek yes sir so what has changed I mean it's just UPI right um I I think it's just UPI I mean think about what changed around the world uh internet became more predominant think about India we went from some 14% internet penetration to almost I think around 50% so because it's online and it's easier to actually transact there is just no friction yes correct see so my hairdresser say Mya my electricity bill I pay online everything and what about your home rent uh UPI or bank transfer yeah most people actually don't you may use it once in a while but most of us just use the internet to pay which is easier and I think demonetization just accelerated all of this this would happen but we just went in like 5x speed because demonetization happened and covid happened so everything went on fast forward and we just adopted it much quicker so I everything is online it's safe and plus we get cash back and rewards too isn't that better yeah 100% I think everything that the internet has done has made our lives including mine super easy correct but think about this right what is the one thing that the internet does really well gives everyone equal access right and makes things faster and easier correct correct so everything is good when friction is reduced but certain things may friction is actually good one thing is payments if payments are too easy to do and you don't have self-discipline and most of us don't you just spend more easily now you can just tap tap and it's at home uh the problem is all those transactions you showed me it's because of conv venience and this is not you it's everyone in fact there was a study with a 100,000 Indian families where they checked the usage of cash and UPI UPI 1 UPI 1 in number of transactions and also total spending which actually went up because it was easier oh you tend to spend more that's what happened with me right think about credit cards also no what is a credit card it's money you don't have that you can spend Alan okay a loone correct now tell me this abishek if you didn't have a credit card but you had to take a personal loan to get a phone would you go to a bank get a personal loan then go back to the store and buy the phone no probably not but what if I told you give me your card I'll tap it or I'll swipe it it's easier right give me your card no but you get the point credit cards also made taking a loan easier which is why people who have credit cards actually spend more same thing with UPI although it's money in your account it's easier to spend we're not an advocate for any kind of money system I mean if you look at the B system you'd have to go and negotiate with people to actually get something then you look at say what happened with money there was wear and te fake currency all of that but with UPI and other online payments the problem is not this physical thing the problem is psychological so what was your last large purchase uh the shoes sir the new ones you bought the latest one yes the expensive ones how did you buy them like what's the so I just selected the product on the Ecom platform okay I was not planning to buy it but I added to the cart then I went on the internet to check the reviews about the product so I have gone through multiple articles blog posts Etc probably watched a couple of YouTube videos to see if the product was good and I don't know later on I just bought it got it okay and uh what's the name of the shoe can you type it over yeah of course this one right correct tell me good don't you follow these celebrities like Andy they also wearing the shoe have you seen these videos before yes came to came on my feed interesting right so we are in the age of nudges now let's think about a time 10 or 20 years ago where you would look at an ad at a newspaper or the television or the radio and you would simply to ignore the ad switch it off or or change the channel or py the page there was a way to ignore it they would just put an ad and hope someone would like it would come and byy but with the internet they have a special weapon and that weapon is data you abishek your Footprints in the Sand digitally on the internet so when you went on the e-commerce platform and added it they probably put you inside a add to cart flow so that's why I was seeing those multiple videos and photos about that well uh if you think about it after that your next step step was you started going to blogs okay now blogs earn by giving good reviews and I'm sure you follow a blogger who gives good reviews for shoes how does he earn he One Source is by putting ads and this could be using Google or Facebook Network ads which means now Google and Facebook know you are looking to buy these white shoes oh which means when you go to YouTube and on Instagram they know what to sell you so in your feed and in your in video YouTube you will actually see those shoes and this is a nudge and they'll show it to you in different situations with different CBS in the best way possible that will appeal to you the most which causes the impulse buy so it's not entirely your fault this is new to humanity and this nudge is what we should know exists so we don't make such impulse purchases has it ever happened that you're talking to a friend about something on the phone or in person and suddenly start seeing ads of that thing yes it has yes correct have you ever spoken to a friend and suddenly seen that product's ad in your phone if you have tell me in the comments below so that's how nudge marketing Works they find out what you want they keep nudging you until they reach a purchase point this was not there in the past it was just a normal ad but now it's targeted to what you want so and an impulse purchase happens because of it another reason why this happens is think about human behavior we'll go back 15 years I'll tell you I used to get up in the morning I have some money in the account and then I had to buy let's say groceries or shoes or whatever I need I would get ready walk out drive to the nearest ATM walk into the ATM calculate how much I actually need put the card inside take the money out not too much then drive to the store make that purchase come back with some change again have to calculate it properly go to the the second store make that purchase come back the day has gone by and I would plan this a few days in advance because the friction was high now imagine the same transaction you tell me how would you do it just like this tuck tuck correct and it'll probably be delivered at home too of course so how many days of planning do you need for a purchase like that 10 seconds that's the problem exactly in fact that kind of friction was good because you would plan ahead and unless it was really really important you just wouldn't do it State Bank of India said that they went from 15 ATM visits to just8 correct obviously because all the payments are happening online and they're so easy yeah correct nobody goes to the ATM who goes to the exactly people don't go to the ATM and they also don't go to the mall as much but you can see it in these Black Friday sales you remember those videos we've seen of people like them dying to get in and that has like countown account down and then people go inside so this is the photo of a Black Friday sale over here and there was absolutely no one over there at all in the store in the store because everyone was buying online yeah so think about this here's what's happening now you get your money credited to your account right a bunch of payments happen on autopay oh the Netflix you don't even know that these payments are happening and the feel of money leaving your account is just not felt then you're doing a bunch of impulse purchases because again you have to pay again it doesn't feel like you're paying because it's so easy correct you see that yes do that again there's probably a up pin this is what happens UPI pin is probably your muscle memory which makes it even easier to do that now the problem with that is it's easy but you don't feel that the money is leaving and because of that you have no control on your expenses that's why the count is zero that's why you don't have money left over to invest and I think there are a bunch of other problems here now you'll be bombarded by more products to make it even easier to make it feel like it's super easy for money to leave your account like UPI light few hundred rupes without a PIN the payments made that credit card with a tab feature that's how I bought the shoes you bought shoes on a tap so again it's easy don't feel that the money is leaving and say Dynamic QR codes where you're not even putting the money the point is you scan the money comes you just put the pin and it's done yes the process of friction means you know money is leaving are you sure are you sure are you sure it's leaving your account are you sure that was there with cash but this is convenient no but it's so easy you don't feel the money is leaving and that's why you don't have any money left so now that we know all of this we should think about the psychology behind impulse buying um one is like say for more sir I know okay okay what am I supposed to do no so look uh um py ological biases are just that if you are aware that they exist they will reduce so foro is oh something is out it will not be available in the next 2 hours so as long as you know this is a psychological bias and you tell yourself nothing is limited nothing is scarce I can do this when I feel like and you don't feel the pressure of time maybe some of those impulse purchases could reduce H another bias is anchoring bias have you seen um any sale happening in the mall or maybe online correct that these shoes were say 100 rupees now they're 50 rupees for a limited period of time 5,000 okay fine 5,000 now they're being sold at 3,000 okay so you feel there is a 2,000 discount actually it's an anchoring bias because you anchored to 5,000 first and thought a which 3,000 is cheaper to buy it but actually it's 3,000 more than what you would have spent anyway so you're anchored to something else just think of it like being distracted on the wrong thing you should ask yourself do I really need this should I purchase it it's not cheaper you're just spending something that maybe you shouldn't I asked this after buying the product that's right digital spending impulse purchase I got it take okay uh okay but there is one more thing I think I forgot to mention there will be newer Products that come out that will make the entire process even easier than this how so think about now there's going to be UPI credit which means it's like a credit card but it's not a card it's UPI which means you can do the same pin and spend money you don't have bya UPI it's a card when you have cash imagine you could spend money you don't have with the ease of UPI and the QR code and the madness this will be crazy and I cannot do another episode just on that if you want tell me in the comments below maybe I should give you a checklist because we always give you a checklist first a cooling off period very simply put when you get excited about something wait 24 hours before you actually make the purchase second you could keep separate bank accounts you get your salary put most of your salary inside this other space which you don't have access to as much and you use your primary bank account for normal spending okay also you should think about having a weekly budget so you know next review all your autop pays how many autopay subscriptions do you have precisely my point he has no idea and maybe you don't too put it in the comments below how many autopay do you have review them make sure you need them and then cancel the ones you don't need and finally the most important thing when you get your salary that's the time you decide how much do you want to invest so you withdraw that amount put it in a different bank account or wherever you're investing and then whatever you're left with that's what you live your month on not the other way around it's the other way dude so now we've done all these episodes on psychology from money to spending to God knows what is it even useful guys put it in the comments if you think that this series is good and check out all the other series and all the problems this boy has and the stuff I have to deal with for him to actually work in this office I'm not sure if you're getting an incentive because you take so much of my time are sir very useful Series so please let him know write down in the comments very good series subscribe right now please do and I'll get the incentive no incentive subscription what incentive no don't disturb me dude bye sir sir sir M dude you have tissue at home no if you have five boxes already will you go to the mall to get more tissue I agree so change my point was if you have it you will not go it change the exam long [Laughter] weekend",

    "transcript_full": "sir your bro is buying a car you're not my bro and you're buying a car bmw bmw how are you buying a bmw you can't afford a bmw it's it's under my budget my budget was 12 lacs yes remember now i'm getting a bmw bmw bmw land let me tell you one are you going to go out on a drive no i don't want to go on a car let me explain how a used car and a new car works 12 lakhs you said right for a bmw versus a new car and whatever makes sense you'll do it and then you won't take an off you have a checklist for this too of course i have a checklist for this but before this go get a pen and paper i'll have to i have to buy a in this video we're gonna talk about whether you should buy a new car or a used car so let's begin yes sir i don't have enough time but it's just gonna take ten minutes so first i want you to answer a bunch of questions that i just wrote down it can be an expression also you will also do this with me first question so what's the cost of buying the car what's the cost of buying the car what's the down payment oh so the cost is 12 lakhs i think i'll pay 1 lakh 1 lakh 8 lakhs loan hold up yeah you will get about 90 to 95% of the loan on the on road price of a new car right yes but for a used car you will actually only get about 70 to 75% of the entire amount as a loan the rest you have to pay from your own pocket not my pocket 70% of the cost 70% is that's the loan and the rest that means 30% you'll have to pay from your own pocket that's not how it works yeah that's that's exactly how it works and please write this down 70% loan 30% down from your pocket perfect so 70% loan 30% cash what's the interest on the loan i i don't know i'll have to ask if i check over here i can see eight to 9% does that sound right yeah that's okay how old is your car ten years ten years now what do you think when you take a loan who really owns the car you or the bank bank now the bank sees the car as an asset okay so as an asset which asset is riskier the new car or the old car think the old car will will be more on the riskier side because it's old parts are older correct it may not run resale value kam oge no what's the point so to mitigate this risk what will the bank do it will charge more interest on a used car so it will be 13 or 14% this is also a cost and i think if you're buying the entire thing in cash then of course this interest rate obviously doesn't matter let me show you a table so the pre owned car won't have a registration fee but your new car will because it's already registered correct but there is a transfer fee of 2,000 to 5,000 depending on where you are so let's check your answer are you buying a used bmw so others can see you drive it yes of course it will make me look cool i'll drive the bmw exactly right so the motivation to get the car is so others see you not the satisfaction of driving the car i am satisfied no but actually when other people see you you'll get this caught in this validation trap so think about it maybe that's not a good reason to buy i found something interesting to tell you what's the running cost of the car mileage let me just go buy it and i'll let you know okay what is the new car mileage i don't know you but let's understand what the cost is fair fair you buy it i've fair tell you so basically this is how much you'll be spending every month more add this to the cost so when you come and say baharlak me bmw mille it's not right because you have to add add it add it next page add it cost of fuel per kilometre for a new car with 17 kilometres a litre is 5.88 for a secondhand luxury car it's probably around 9.09 now that's roughly 3.2 rupees extra for each kilometer now assume he's travelling 50 kilometers for three hundred days a year then the extra cost is 48,000 rupees and over the next five years i'm assuming you'll use the car that adds up to 2.4 lakh rupees extra extra of course if you don't travel 50 kilometers itna kachana yoga but obviously you have to take into account how much extra you're paying because you're buying a luxury car now cool okay fair alright and i think you should always know that a new car is always more fuel efficient than an old car because technology is improving you're not letting me buy a new car you're not letting me buy an old car what should i do what should i buy i need to advise you i spent so much time on you ungrateful cool now moving on to the next point let's start with maintenance okay now maintenance you have to do service correct in a new car the first few services are free and you need to get it after every few months correct right maybe six months i mean there there's a different criteria yeah 50,000 kilometers etcetera etcetera but for an old car the frequency of the service increases correct because wear and tear is higher and the cost of the service is also slightly higher correct and i'm sure bmw's service cost will be pretty high if i don't drive that car every day i'm fine by the emi's if i don't drive that car every day i'll not have to get that serviced every quarter i'll save money yeah but then why are you buying it in the first place anyway there's one more point over here the spare parts sometimes what happens is that the spare parts are not do i get that prepared sometimes it happens very often but the point is if the insurance doesn't cover it you will have to pay for it and it's it's really expensive so insurance premium is really expensive if the parts have to be imported that's a problem and it just becomes a hassle in fact i know there is someone watching this right now who's heard about this please tell the story of a used car problems with service and changing parts in the comments so we can all learn from each other right please do okay fine noted let me just so basically the cost of maintaining an old car is way way higher and before you buy a used car you should find out what that cost roughly is over the next five years cool fair right yeah yeah fantastic what have you given away when you take a loan savings actually when you take a loan you're giving away a slice of your future earnings hey in other words you're giving away the most precious thing you have money time be very careful of how much you actually do it but that's how i want to live no that's not good i i should not live and now we have finally the best part resale value of your used car i have a simple so what's what's new in that check this out so this is the age of the car and this is the depreciation now notice the moment you drive the car 15% gone after one to two years of use about 20% gone about two to three years of use 30% is gone then it reduces three to four years about 40% is gone depreciated of the value of the car i came up with these numbers four to five years 50% so after five years you need to manually decide it amongst parties to find out what that depreciation is to know the depreciation rates according to the income tax act and companies act check out the doc in the description so the value of your used car for a resale again is really bad actually but you can sell your new car for at least maybe you've lost 30% or 40% of the value you'll get some resale value from it so you should include that as a cost as well you're convincing me not to buy this bmw no you should buy the bmw you should just know what you're getting into don't you hate me actually i have a friend abib and he bought a car which was a luxury high performance car for a low amount and it is a really old car did he make a mistake i i don't know in his case he did not he's a motor head he took a mechanic with him he understands cars that's all he obsesses about he knows what he was buying and it's actually a really good purchase he knows what to do with it what not to do with it he really understands cars so if you're a motor head and you really understand cars you can make this work but if you're scrolling on instagram and you're like dude you're buying it out of just fun you will almost always make the worst choice so what you're saying is i'll have to take a mechanic today so am i saying you shouldn't buy the old car yes i'm not saying that i'm saying you should know all of these points before you buy a old car and buying an old car will save you money but if you buy a luxury old car things change a lot so if you're not buying a luxury old car a lot of these things may not make sense",

    "transcript_full": "rupees 50,000 per month in dividend passive income today we're going to create an actual portfolio to prove that huh this is possible I mean look at all these posts over here wow so much Moola today we will actually create the portfolio to prove that this can be done but in true de influencing style we'll actually talk about the risks involved in actually doing this because these guys they don't talk about it so first we'll create a portfolio second we'll find out what number we need to get to 50,000 Rupees a month passively and third we'll talk about all the risks involved but before we actually do that hit that like and that subscribe button because I need your like I need that subscribe so let's start with step number [Music] one so let's start right from the Basics what's a dividend let's go back to the 1600s where the Dutch East India Company For The First Time in the World Went public which meant the arm admy or well the Royals and the rich people could invest and get shares now this company is very special they would go around the world in ships risking their lives to get back spices and spices made a lot of profit now obviously the investors put in money to make these voyages possible so to actually make an exit or give some return on these Investments the answer was simple take the profits and redistribute a part of them to the investors that's called a dividend even today all these companies over here give dividend from their profits not all of it a part of their profits the first thing we need to know is what kind of company can actually pay a dividend obviously a profitable company otherwise they'll have no money to give back but do note sometimes non profitable companies may also pay a dividend since they have a robust cash Reserve so the metric we need to look at is R oce now I won't get too much into the details of this basically it's a measure to understand what percentage of profit is the company able to make with respect to the total Capital employed by the company for example a capital employed of 1 CR you don't want them to be making one rupe profit you probably want them to make 10% or 10 lakh Rupees profit so it not only tells you profitability it also Al tells you efficiency whether it's good or not the RSC metric we need to qualify for our portfolio is 10% or greater so this is something we absolutely need can't be below this the second metric is EPS EPS or earnings now there are multiple ways to look at this but basically we want earnings to be going up the only way earnings can be going up over five or six year period is if the company is doing very well and also the market is also growing the industry is also growing so second thing we need is EPS actually growing that's our second metric for our screener the third metric is going to be dividend yield now I am damn sure you would have seen a paper like this saying do so% Dividend does that mean if you put in 1 lakh rupees 2 lakh rupees will come back absolutely not just like most things in finance things have a let me explain moment so over here it's very simple the 200% dividend declared that you see on newspapers or the internet is on the face value which is 2 4 or 5 rupees which doesn't make a big difference to you what matters to you is how much money did you put in and how much dividend are you getting on the capital you have invested dividend yield does exactly that it takes the dividend amount divides it by the current market price to give you a percentage in the market any dividend yield above 2% is wow amazing ma now why is the 2% or greater dividend considered amazing because the company's job is not to give you a source of passive income or a source of income where it's giving you part of the profits its job is to actually grow the company the growth happens and hopefully the share price also appreciates so this capital appreciation a company's job is not to give dividend if it does great thanks but that's not why it primarily exists anyway let's move on to make this screener I have all these three metrics and I'll open it up over here run it and hit done I've also marked this as I've also sorted it as per market cap we've also add market cap greater than 10,000 crores which makes this greater than a billion dollar so the largest companies come first followed by the least smallest companies below that now you'll see a new uh column over here called dividend yield look at that that's the dividend yield that's amazing right and some companies like Co India Etc have really large dividend yields sounds tasty but here is the problem let's suppose you make the portfolio out of this of say 15 or 20 stocks your average dividend yield will come to 4% or 5% now to actually make 50,000 rupes a month or 6 lakh rupees a year you will have to have a capital of 1.5 crores now most of us don't have that kind of capital so if anyone tells you you can do XYZ to make passive income from the market they are lying it's not true it is false the second problem is since the job of the company is not to give you a dividend but to actually grow the business it one day may decide it doesn't want to give the dividend so even if you have that 1.5 crores and even if you create that portfolio there's no sort of guarantee where they have to give that dividend it's their choice it's their way of rewarding their investors and for some reason they may choose just not to do it one day the third problem is the dividend yield itself now if you take a look at say ITC when the price of the stock was lower its yield was a beautiful 6% then the stock Rose and the yield is now around 2 3% what does this mean does it make ITC a Bad Company not at all actually it has nothing to do with the company it just has to do with your perspective of trying to make a passive income that's not how an investor should think an investor should think he thinks these 15 20 30 companies are amazing and you should try to hold them for as long as possible even better yet try to hold an index fund nifty50 stocks and hold them for as long as possible creating a portfolio to create a passive income out of especially stocks just doesn't work you should throw this mindset away another red flag and might I say the largest biggest red flag is capital erosion if you pick a stock because the dividend yield seems attractive but the company itself isn't good the business isn't good then the stock price could fall significantly let's say the stock price falls 30 40 50% suddenly that 2 or 3% dividend yield won't mean much so here's the mindset of how you should think about this one Stock Investing is a long-term game for capital appreciation not dividends two identify what kind of investor are you you're either picking stocks of your own creating your own portfolio or just simply inv investing in an index fund number three if you do this for a really long time you might just get a little lucky and some of the stocks you bought not for dividends do pay out a dividend and because your portfolio becomes large and you did this for decades the dividend payout will be nice then you can probably make a real about it and the cycle can start all over again for example Warren Baba over here makes billions of dollars just from dividend but he didn't buy those companies for the dividend he bought it because the business was good so you should also think the same we've been thinking of creating this series for a while now and we wanted to start with this de influencing Series where we basically try to Target the greedy people in the market explain them and tease them with the greed talk about how it's possible and then explain all the risks all of it so if you miss some Risk please put it in

series please tell us what other things we should include in the de influencing series put it in the comments below and we'll come up with a bunch more every single week if you enjoyed this hit that

    "title_current": "EMI or Rent: What’s Best in Your 20s?",
    "transcript_full": "Sir, I am taking a flat. Flat. Why? What happened? Correct. Come here. Sir, that building is visible, that is the office, and there is a highway coming up. Okay? Now look there, that's the airport. One minute. Why are you telling me all this? I have taken a flat on the 14th floor of the building in which we are standing. Flat? Can you go back to reality? Okay. Tell me one thing, how are you buying this house? On EMI. Okay, and how did you calculate EMI. Okay. So I went to Google. And this is EMI, 20,000? Correct. And you think you can afford this. EMI is not the only thing to look at, when you buy a house. What remains now, Sir? Let me tell you. So here's a 3 point check list. Okay? Okay. The first thing is your Emergency Fund. Remember we talked about it? The money that we save. Yes, so basically whatever is your monthly expense, what is that for you? It might be roughly, Fifty thousand. So, for six months it will be Three lakh rupees. Three lakh rupees. Correct. But now, your EMI which is 20000 is also getting added. Yes, correct. Will you add that too? If we reduce the party a little, the expenses can come down to Forty, adding twenty to it becomes sixty thousand. Correct. I mean sir, the average is 60 thousand. The point is your current Emergency Fund is not enough to actually think about buying the home. So increase that Emergency Fund a little, so that we can add it. This is important,friend. I mean peace of mind is important. And secondly, your EMI which you told me, is Twenty thousand. Yes. Not much you think, but who will pay the stamp duty? Registration has to be given, property tax will be paid. The one who is Ajay, the broker, your friend, you will have to give brokerage to him also. These are  only one time, but there is an expense. Then Society charges every single month. Even if you don't use the Gym, you still pay Maintenance. Who will give all this? Have you added all of this? See this. This is your EMI but you have all these other expenses and that shouldn't go from your savings. You should plan for it. Oh man. I am not saying don't buy, buy the house. But you should just know how much it will cost, that's all. So that there is no surprise. Okay. And then why are you buying it, hope its not because papa has said that we should buy a house. Okay Sir, means finance is fine. But I mean papa also took it, Now I am earning, then I have to show it. So I think these are the things. What does it mean to show? Social, society pressure. I mean how am I doing good? Are you buying this because papa said? Are you buying it because you really like the house or are you buying it because this is an investment. What is the role? Sir,papa said but I also likes the house. You have seen everything is around. So I think maybe its fine for investment purpose also because the price will increase. So in this, I think ‘papa said,’is not good enough reason. You should buy it because you want it. Second, if you are buying it for investment, there are better ways to invest your money. If you want to make money from money, there are many ways, leave stocks, you can do bonds also. Seeing this just from investment perspective is not right. You are buying a home because it's an emotional decision because you want a roof over your head but don't buy because of external pressure But I can stay there for a while, right? Yes. So, if you are buying a house to live there and the rest of your investments, Emergency Fund, Insurance are all sorted, and you feel that your job or business is going well. Because I think it’s a big commitment. The loan must be for twenty years or maybe more? Twenty years. Twenty years loan plus that's a commitment and until that the loan is not completed, this house is not yours. It belongs to the bank. For example, at some point you stop paying EMI. Suppose you paid EMI for ten years and you are unable to pay after this. You lose your job, let's take an example. What’lll happen? Bank will take the house and push me out. Correct. And I will be on the road. No, don't think like that. You still have salary you can rent out a home and all of that. But just now you said that I lost my job. You have some Emergency Fund. Right? With Emergency Fund, maybe you're unable to pay EMI. Twenty thousand is a big amount If you are not getting income then what happens is that, house now, belongs to the bank and it's gone. So, ten years’ EMI is also gone, you don't get that money back. Because the bank tries to sell it at a lower rate to recover its asset. That means, I paid EMI for ten years. Yes. In the eleventh year I forgot. Yes. So the bank will sell. Let's sell it for any amount, It'll not give me anything. You'll not get anything. You have, you have buyers insurance, if you pass away, I hope that doesn't happen but that EMI doesn't get passed on to your kin. So, if you pass away, the insurance takes care of the EMI but if you are still alive and if you don't pay the EMI, then the bank will take your home. Hey Sir, don't scare me so much. Fear will stop haunting you  only when you have the complete picture. So let's talk about the good stuff. You have created a lot of confusion. Which confusion? Tell me further. So, let's start with tax benefits and I have opened up 3 over here. First is this 24 B. If you actually occupy the home, meaning you have bought the house to stay, then Rs 2 lakhs are deducted annually on interest. EMI will also be reduced then. EMI will not be reduced. Your taxable amount will be reduced. Tax will be saved. But my apartment is under construction. So what about such property? No, it is simple, you can do deduction only then when property is built, in that financial year, you can make deduction. But property should be built. I am already paying the EMI. Keep paying it. Huh? Yes. After that, Section 80C, deduction on home loan principle payment, then you can do 1.5 lakhs a year on principle amount repay. When you'll pay EMI, So, EMI consist of interest portion and a principle portion. I give whatever the bank asks for. Right. Yes, but basically you can talk to your CA. Then in home loan interest, you can reduce 2 lakh on interest part and then 1.5 lakhs a year on principle amount repaid. but this is for self occupied and rented houses. So even if you give it on rent, you can actually save 1.5 lakhs per year under section 80C, from your income. You can't save, but, deduct from your income. Your taxable income will reduce. And you can do this thing on stamp duty and during registration also. So that is your total cost. Isn't it? Can we save there as well on stamp duty. Yes, that's also deductible up to this amount. And then in section 80E, additional deduction for first time home buyers. Is this your first house. Yes. So, if someone is buying house first time and he has taken it on loan, you can take additional deduction of fifty thousand of the amount of loan taken is less than Rs 35 lakhs. And if its more? So can't take it. Do you have a loan of more than Rs 35 lakh? Continue. Basically, if anyone's buying a house for the first time, these benefits are given to him by government. Do you even read that much? Yes, so now you know. So this is good, this is a very good benefit actually. Didn't even know this. Now what do you think about real estate as an investment? It's great isn't it, father, grandfather, everyone bought flats, lands. Correct? Would have bought it sometime, now it's worth Crores. So correct! Boomers and their fathers have seen very good real estate appreciation. So is our generation, but we look at stocks a little more. Times have changed a bit, Sir. Times have changed a bit. Correct, but real estate does appreciate. Generally considered in industry that you get 3 to 4 percent, sometimes 4.5 to 5 percent CAGR per year on real estate. But sir, some people have doubled and tripled the amount in a year. It is possible. Actually this is a very nuanced subject. We cannot say that real estate has given 'X' return. Now in stocks, you say NIFTY has given this return. Then it is fair. There is a lot of cherrypicking in real estate. What is the location? Where is it, is there any construction there or not? Has government announced some projects. Airport! Airports. Are there schools or not? etc. What type of companies are hiring there? That also matters, what are the average salaries of people, that also matters. What is the age group, that also matters. Amount of property based on that? On that basis, property Rises or falls, but to be honest you cannot calculate this and I think we all know someone who is very good at property, I am certainly not an expert. But you can't know the return. I think 3 to 4.5 percent CAGR is what you can maybe.. Investment. Then I don't feel like it. But you are not buying for investment, right? No this is to stay. Buying to live. For now. So that's fine, As long as it does not squeeze you financially. No Sir, at least I will be saved from paying rent. Meaning rent is equal to EMI but its giving something. Man, I never understood this. If you buy a house worth Rs 1 crore. Okay? And the annual rent you get is Rs 3 lakh. Then it become 3 percent rental yield. Okay? That means it will take you 33 years to get that money back. So actually, the EMI on a house worth Rs 1 crore will be this. So, there is actually a lot of difference in the rent versus EMI. It's not that you will save on rent. This is not true, I don't know why people think so. Maybe interchangeable in some homes, some locations. But there is some personal choice in this. Now I feel,personally, that it doesn't seem like it in this phase of my life. Maybe I need to take it after two years. So that's a personal choice and should we do everything for return only? Is everything for money? We earn money for some good memories and good emotional attachments. So this is your personal choice. Okay. Yes, but don't tell yourself that's great investment, it will be very good. Don't say all this, just be factual about it and say that I am buying it because I want to. That's the correct answer. Okay, So basically I understood this emotional point. Yes. But if me or anyone wants to double the money, then how will he do it with real estate? Well, Firstly I think you have to find someone who really understands real estate and has been doing it for twenty-thirty years. I know some people. What are they doing? Real estate. So they buy commercial properties and shops and then sell. I don't know how that happens. And you will have to really spend time and develop that skill, that how to make money from real estate. I don't know,but it's a skill that you can decide to learn over the next 5-10 years. If you have any experience, please post in comments. I would love to know, what has been your real estate experience? In 2023,I think your life is in your office because you spend 90 percent of your time here. Your life at home which could be with your wife, with your girlfriend or with yourself. One of the three? Third. Third. Just self. And third is your family, mother, father, extended family. Now in these three things, this is the trifactor. You want to make sure that you are happy with these three things. If your pressure is so much due to EMI that you are not able to enjoy Diwali there's more tension in the office or there is anxiety at home? Then it's not worth it. After this if you feel that you'll get mental peace from home, then you should do it. What are you doing now? Buying a home? Now, Yes, I mean will buy it sometime. I have great news, Look, here is a very handsome groom, he is single, looks great. Really wants to earn money. Now, he got a house.

    "transcript_full": "the thing about money is and no one's ever told you is that the more you get it isn't always good for example when we live in times like this you get this shiny little plastic thing and it's digital too and you can swipe away and buy whatever you want because PESA who needs a plan and an Excel sheet to look at all the different charges the yearly payments the interest rates because you don't even know that this exists so today we'll talk about something you know but don't want to address through a story of a friend or someone who always troubles me when I'm working abishek oh look at all that cash you're investing now right yeah investing started this is for my emis emis all the products that I've bought isn't that a lot no no I'm getting increment next month no so everything is sorted dude I know exactly how much your salary is this is a lot plus increment no no no the increment may not happen even I don't know about it cuz I'm your boss technically so dude tell me this do you know how much debt is too much debt too much debt I am not in too much debt I am fine anyone thinking of getting debt has debt or maybe wants to get rid of debt should watch this because today we're going to sort with this guy out that he probably has way too much Emi and debt and we'll find a way with all these three things are you ready I am sorted maybe these guys are in debt I am [Music] not so dude let's first figure out how much debt you actually have so I obviously know how much your salary is so but before that put in your debt amount monthly Emi okay got it and I'll divide it by nice you have a debt to income ratio of 60% that's nice 60% of what you earn goes in emis 40% I'm saving no this means how will you live your life how will will you grow how will you invest how will you take care of an emergency what if someone gets sick there are so many things in life you cannot predict and that's what life mostly is what will you do ideally your debt to income ratio should not exceed like 33% oh so when I get an increment it will drop down to 30% dude let's assume you're not getting an increment for the next 2 years 33% keer if you're going it is Red Zone now everyone's life is different I know you don't have a lot of liability right but I have some friends even at your age they had to take care of parents and and different things and they had liability which means even 33% for them would be really high so judge what that number is check it out in the description we've left some information for you but it shouldn't cross 33% for you sir so I'll tell you just one thing 60% is higher maybe I don't have any liabilities uh I'll get increment I'll get good bonus and this 60% will drop down to somewhere 30% so I think I live my life uh like the way I'm living so I think living life Carefree is not having the BGE of debt on you but here are some other red flags and you tell me if 60% is okay okay first if you ever think that you're struggling on basic living payments right rent payment car payment maybe electricity maybe stuff that you have to just pay even a basic credit card bill you're not able to pay and you're delaying it that means something is wrong that is a red flag that says you've taken too much debt has that happened to you ever yeah but I can use my emergency fund no say that again I'll refill it I'll use my emergency F the emergency fund is emergency fund this is emergency paying rent is not emergency where will I live exactly true true fair but paying rent is living you can't use an emergency fund for that emergency fund is used for emergency that's the second red flag you can't be using it emergency fund I excused it so what will you do in times of say another covid happens is that a double emergency what is that huh huh third red flag paying off a credit card with another credit card I just did it I bought this new card hold up don't you think there's something wrong with that credit is money you don't own then you get another credit card to pay off this credit card I'm paying that bill no it's a red flag that's your third red flag the fourth red flag sir fourth red flag I'll tell you you are the red flag in my life my exes used to call me red flag again you are calling me red flag red flag fine it's actually simple math there's nothing to do with me and your girlfriends and you uh fine I think it's simple math and just like we have girl math boy math we have alcohol math see when you have one nice drink uh do you stop at one no you go for the second and then you have to have a third but you have to have the fourth so it seems like alcohol all multiplies itself when you start you can't stop and there's always a reason to continue it's exactly like debt math when you start you can't stop and you like it and you it keeps growing and that's a problem Oh and really addition is multiplication because it just doesn't stop Dude tell me why do you have so many loans and what are you trying to buy like is this house there car like what these are not loans sir so basically loans are you go to the bank fill up the paperwork give them collateral blah blah you get the loan these are buy now pay later schemes I just make some payments online and Emi is done and these are not loans correct because you didn't go to the bank correct and it's not a personal loan so there's no issue correct it was just online this is the problem anything that you don't own that you're buying is called buying on credit you bought it through a card or some other way this means you eventually have to pay that money back a loan is a loan is a loan whether you sign a piece of paper or not a tell me what phone do you have same this one iPhone okay and how do you listen to music airpods and what laptop do you use uh MacBook ah even you thought he's going to say this why do you have this entire Apple expensive stuff it's a good family no they're connected so I think I know what's happening this is called a consumption spiral where you take one step and you say Second Step then you say third step and then you take the fourth and fifth and then you're at 7% 60% debt look this is called the Dido effect it's very simple it's like the Dido effect doesn't matter it basically means because you've consumed one thing there is a need to consume a second third and fourth and fifth otherwise you know you just don't feel complete and it's not Apple's fault Apple makes great products the problem is with you and there's a snowball of shopping right so in this case in your particular case you just wanted to be you wanted to get some cool Tech that's all connected and you have these reasons to get it it could also be with your home when you move to that new apartment you got a rug a really nice rug good Furniture but then you need a furniture on top of it good and then you need nice Cutlery and then when you're sitting and doing this what will you watch you need a nice TV it never ends my point is if you start once you can't stop but you have to first see can you really afford it or not now that you know this and you know that you're at 60% do you see something's wrong here I didn't realize BBE yes but sir why do we humans do this which brings us to our next segment the psychology behind it humans need to assign a value to something to tell themselves that their life is not meaningless because maybe life is in the 1600s the Tulips were a reason why people got status would you give me your entire year salary for this are you crazy a tulip for this salary I wouldn't pay a penny but people actually sold all of their land all the money just to buy a tulip to show status amongst people they man status does that sound crazy sounds crazy why would someone pay for this FL it doesn't make Financial sense right A lot of these people could not take care of their kids have food because of this decision sounds stupid doesn't it correct and what about 2024 where someone spent 60% of their yearly income on stuff that they cannot own and if I took all of your loans and compared it to your yearly salary you've already spent the next four or five years of what you will earn in a loan does that make any sense I don't think so this is actually called status anxiety we all face status anxiety and Status questions it's completely normal but you can't let it take over so when an emergency happens you lose the plot and you can't live on normal life that you are you can't risk being ruined damn sir I didn't even realize this was the extent of my debt now help me understand one thing how will I be able to control this this buying stuff because I am for sure will end up buying more products and I don't even know I'll be using it or not it's actually not your fault some of the smartest people in the world who study psychology and user Behavior have designed certain things on the internet to make you impulse by have you ever felt every day it's not your fault so if you feel you've ever done an Impulse spy check this checklist out you go through this entire checklist before you make a purchase this way you can rewire your brain perfect I got this checklist I am never going to take debt in my life for sure you're never going to take debt in your life correct ever debt free dude why are you so extreme there's nothing wrong with debt it's wrong if you take too much debt you'll have to buy a house or a car or something in the future and getting that kind of debt that you can afford is great and it's fine so I think you don't understand good debt and bad debt what's good debt what's bad debt which brings us to our next segment game show time you are buying an iPhone and paying 20,000 Emi salary is 30,000 bad debt you are paying 20,000 Emi and salary is 2 lakhs good debt you take a huge loan of 25 lakhs as an educational loan uh good debt yeah I think if you take an educational loan that can upscale you and get you higher salary in the future another question you want to buy a brand new car worth let's say 25 lakh rupees the Emi somehow is 30,000 rupees and your monthly salary is 50,000 bad debt nice you get the point so dude the problem becomes when a debt becomes a debt spiral that's when things get messed up spiral what's that I mean there's one event that happens which forces you to take debt and then one step later you're just accumulating more debt is that even real so I have my emis and I'm able to pay them back no no I totally agree let's imagine that uh something happens and you have and you end up in a hospital okay God forbid at this point there's a 2 lakh rupee new bill which you can't afford and you have to take it on credit now you have left the hospital and back to your normal life but you're paying your normal emis as well correct you're at % for example plus another 2 lakhs now you have actual pressure so now what you're going to do is you have to reduce your spending on other things because well you have to pay this unforeseen payment but now what happens is you have to start paying minimum payments in all your debt because well salary because of that your credit score gets hit and your credit score comes down which means any future loans will be more expensive and if it's too low worse you won't get a loan at all after this you get a little demotivated at work because there's so much stress and maybe you miss that pay rise because your performance in the office isn't as good again more pressure now on the income side now that you're paying your minimum dues after 6 months you realize damn my total debt has increased because minimum debt means more interest more interest and your entire thing has become this huge ball of a problem now you don't like your life and maybe the office is not doing well maybe you might lose your job and this is called a dead spiral it will go on and on until a point where you actually crack which means the real security and freedom is not having debt and deal with life's uncertainties does that make any sense so that was the story of abishek but the real question you need to ask yourself is did you enjoy this acting Pai let me know and put it in the comments below what are you doing about your debt in your life and if you don't have debt say I don't have and we'll give it a life [Music] bye a little little I no little small [Music] G I have a car I have a house I don't have a wife I have girlfriends [Music] X",

wow really thank you so much yeah and oh I'm I'm really sorry Nish I'm getting a really important call can you just hold for a minute ha no problem hello hi Tanya this is shiwani from Viper Tech hi Shani uh Tanya first of all congratulations you have been selected as Instagram manager in Viper tech oh wow thank you you're welcome so actually Tanya we want you to discuss your salary okay since uh we are a starter we can only give you 7 lakhs in the beginning but we'll be giving you 50 lakhs of company esops 50 lakhs that is a lot of money Tanya are you there uh sorry yes I I accept the offer oh that's great I'll send you the offer letter and you can join from next week okay thank you bye okay bye congratulations once again hello sorry for the delay no problem so do you accept the offer uh I'm so sorry I won't be able to accept the offer I have accepted another offer oh it's okay all the best for your future thank [Music] you what [Music] what okay something was definitely wrong with her expectations about esops now the truth is this is the first de influencing episode where you don't know how esops work and a lot of people don't know how to select whether esops is something they should consider when they get a job so in this episode we'll not only explain how they work we'll also de influence you with any myths you had we'll talk about the good and the bad cuz certainly no one else will tell you let's get started [Music] so how can you turn ESOP into actual money the answer is but there are some problems with this if you're joining a startup solely because of the shares in the company beware that this could go to zero and you should be okay with it if you don't buy the shares in the ex exercise period Then the shares are lapsed can esops make you your first cor the answer is yes but like any scheme where you can make your first cor there are a lot of ifs and buts and mugger and uger so we'll answer all of that but before we understand an ESOP let's understand something you already know your salary and your incentive so why are you really paid your salary think about it you join a company because you are serving a need that the company has and for for this service the company has hired you and is paying you a fixed salary correct pretty simple now on top of this how does a company ensure that you go above and beyond your work or you put in your most on things that really matter they may set certain targets of work and if you achieve those targets not only do you get your salary you'll get the second form of payment which is your incentive so if you excel in certain jobs or tasks in the month or the and if it hits a certain number you get an extra push a cherry on the top that's your incentive now the company may also give you a yearend bonus but this obviously differs from company to company now that we've understood salary and incentives they could also be a bonus there's a Third Kind the ESOP guys can we have silence on set please so there is a Third Kind called esops and a great way to dude hey you know actually what I'll just use the pizza as an example it will work I think excuse me can we eat this utan please UT pick it up pick it up pick it up pick it up right here this is mine now thank you bye-bye okay so the way you think about an ESOP or an employee stock option plan is exactly like shares in a company so if you go and buy one share of Reliance you are now an owner of Reliance I'll be a small one but an owner represented by one share this pizza is exactly like the the shares of a company I have 12 slices over here representing the 100% shareholding of one private company and let's say we have two Founders who begin this company let's assume that there is no investor in this case it's just easier to calculate let's also assume they're equal shareholders and they each own six slices of pizza now these two guys have one problem the problem is they're not able to attract enough Talent so they think since they have this groundbreaking idea they will give shares of this company which is right now worth nothing to these other employees and these other employees let's say are these two guys these two people now own shares of the company how much should we give them should we divide the entire p and make it equal of course not because the founders have taken more risk than the employees maybe they started the company a couple years ago maybe they didn't take salary etc etc the risk was higher so what they do is they take out one slice over here this one slice and call it the employee stock option pool this one slice will be divided amongst all the employees they hire in the future now the beauty is this in the one chance in the faint chance that this company does extremely well and when I say extremely well I mean financially in that event the employees participate in that upside but remember this is when you get an ESOP you're not only taking risk because it could go to zero you're also participating in an theoretically unlimited upside so why do founders explanation yeah okay so why do founders give away their precious shares to employees there must be some reason right the first reason is to retain good talent and this is for good reason right I mean if you want to retain Talent they must feel like they own part of the company and they must feel like there is some upside Beyond just their salary and their incentive they feel if the company does well they will be rewarded so this is a great way to retain Talent the second reason is probably the most important reason and that's to feel like you're a owner of the company think about how many of your friends work in dull lifeless jobs Thinking by Weekend a I'll enjoy myself in the weekend because I have to work from Monday to Friday what if this was F what if your hobby was actually your job and you truly really enjoyed it well one way to do that is the reason we like music art dance and to create stuff is because we can call it our own there is a sense of ownership in art which is why we love art but in many cases in corporate life you feel like a cog in the wheel it doesn't feel like you own it one way to show ownership is to actually give the employees ownership once they have it and a little part of their job not entirely but a little part of their job is Art they feel and work better and who wins in the end the employee wins because he's loving his job and second the company wins because they're getting better output because everyone feels like they're an owner sure the founders have to give away a lot to get this but isn't it worth it the last reason is if the company cannot afford a full salary they say Hey you come in half and the rest you can take as ESOP and that's the way the company can hire good talent hold on this may be a reason but honestly it's a huge red flag basically someone trying to get you at a cheaper lower rate and compensating with a lot of ESOP may not be best especially if the company is new so this sounds like a red flag and you should definitely think about it before you consider it if this happens in your life so how can you turn this piece of paper the ESOP into actual money how can you liquidate it how can you sell it how do you it the answer is on this board how can an employee liquidate esops so think of it like this remove employees and turn it into founder SL investor so one of the ways is the stock market if the company is listed let's say you're working at Google and you get shares you can just simply go to the market and sell it it's right there if it's a listed company it becomes a little simpler another way is an IPO basically if the private company you are working with had shares and it IPOs you can sell it again in the stock market so that works too another way is an acquisition an acquisition is simply the acquisition of shares or that entire pizza and in that pizza your esops also exist so you also get an exit there of course there are different versions of this but well that is one way then we have buy back by the company if the company has cash from profits or otherwise they can use that money to buy those shares back from you remember esops are like shares so the same way the founders and the investors exit is the same way you exit but there are some problems with this let's talk about that the first problem is a substitute for your salary so if anyone says that the shares is a substitute for your salary please come and join my startup that's not a good thing the problem here is very simple your basic needs should be covered by a fixed portion that's your salary incentives bonus whatever the ESOP you have to assume could become zero and it will not affect you for example look at Flipkart and Walmart there was an acquisition there Walmart said they will buy only 30% of the vested shares of flip cart now this is not in control of the employees the board decided it and that's the rule so if you're joining a startup solely because of the shares in the company beware that this could go to zero and you should be okay with it that brings us to point number two the cliff and vesting period basically it's a actually that's a good way Hey listen listen hey come here come here come here so basically a cliff investing period is really interesting and I'll explain how it works let's suppose this guy say hi hi he has shares worth let's say 30 lakh rupees and this slice of pizza represents his esops right now the thing is not allowed the cliff basically says if there's a onee cliff it means you are not eligible to get the esops so I have the worth here but exal bad but after a year his vesting begins so what I'll do is I can divide this pizza into another three parts if I divide part one and I divide another part two as soon as one year is over you can pick up one slice this is now vested because he's been here for a year after year two he can pick up the second slice which is another 33% and after year three he can pick the third slice and that's what Cliff investing is this is how it you make sure that you earn your shares in the company by working over a period of time and Building Things versus just getting it like a salary you can put it back now and if you think only employees are going through this guys there are a lot of Founders who raise money from very large V and their own shares go into founder vesting because now we'll talk about exercise price and exercise period it's very simple the value of each of these slices is 10 lakh Rupees 10 lakhs 10 lakhs 10 lakhs but these are shares so you have to buy the shares right so there'll be an exercise price remember you you don't have stocks you have esops which are stock options you the option to buy it if you don't want to buy it don't buy it so each stock I'll offer to you at an exercise price of 1,000 rupees so you can buy all three for 3,000 rupees so that's the exercise price and then there's exercise period where you're allowed to buy these shares and that's called the exercise period so companies do this exercise period and exercise price at different ways so everyone has their own rules and if you don't buy the shares in the exercise period Then the shares are lapsed so these are just some rules you could know but to really know the rule you'll have to ask your company of what their rules are because it becomes unique for every single company cool now once you're ready to exercise it you can actually eat that slice so you can go ahead and do that and brings us to problem number four taxes let's suppose that this 10 lakh Rupees of shares is now vested with you and you exercise it once you've exercised it you will pay to the government your tax laab according to 10 lakhs and you'll pay that amount and now you own that slice feeling good now let's say the value of this pizza doubles therefore the value of this share also doubles so it's gone from 10 lakhs to 20 lakhs now at this point the company buys back the shares from you and you now make 20 lakh rupees but the government says dude you paid tax on 10 lakhs now it's worth 20 so you've earned that extra 10 lakh Rupees so you've got to pay a short-term capital gain or a long-term capital gain on top of that in private companies a short-term capital gain is 2 years and above that is longterm and the tax labs are different for a shortterm you pay equivalent to your tax lab for a longterm you pay 20% flat for a public company the rules are a little different and it's right here in many cases the exercise price and the buyback happens at the same time and if that happens then this calculation is not valid you just simply find the gain pay tax on it and it's over so it's a lot more simpler and finally I have a checklist okay thanks good job bye-bye the checklist is pretty simple if you're joining a startup or a really large company these are some things you should think about before you actually accept the ESOP Point number one written promises if the company says they'll give you ESOP especially when you've not joined the company make sure you have physical proof of the promise either in your office a letter or anything else second accelerated vesting this means if the company's bought out by another company you'll start working for the new company and you'll get a new cliff and a new vesting period which means those numbers increase so you should know what you're signing up for Point number three find the right balance if the company you're joining is offering you a really low salary for the esops make sure you trust that company will grow enough also your inhand shouldn't be low because how will you manage your own expenses number four listed companies if you're joining a listed and valuable company like a Google or Amazon getting esops is a no-brainer because you can sell it in the open market when you want and you can pay taxes on the profits you book but having said that getting esops in a very large company is not as easy as getting esops in a smaller company because a lot of large companies give it to only their Prime big management and they get access to it also you should read the ESOP policy document to understand how the ESOP works I hope this episode was useful I know a lot of people don't see esops in their lives but now you know that this tool exists let us know what other topics to cover in the comments below say d influencing Army and see you in the next [Music] episode isn't I [Music] [Laughter]",

    "transcript_full": "sir not right now I'm working sir look sir not right now I'm working sir you told me to invest in gold so I invested look very nice very nice what you know you look like JY Larry this is not working and I think you should figure out all the different ways you can invest in gold this is not the only way by the way we figure it out with someone else okay I don't want to talk to anybody else especially abish he just shouts at me please you tell me no you figure it out with him I I can't sit and figure things out with you all the time it's what I can give you what is this 22 karat you think I can be bribed like this we'll spend 10 minutes together and I will figure out the different kinds of gold and hopefully help you out Cool [Music] Works before we start talking about all the different ways you can invest in gold you tell me what do you understand about gold what do you think my mom says gold is amazing you should invest in it what do you think I like silver more though diamonds but gold is nice the gold standard used to exist before and then we mve to money and it inherently has value but people perceive that it has value so in times of um desperation when an economic downturn happens or hyperinflation happens or any of these bad things happen in an extreme environment in an economic condition gold is where everyone runs to it's your safe heaven so thinking of gold as an investment perhaps you should change us a little bit think of gold as a hedge it's a cushion and as a cushion it's good because it's unlikely to lose a lot of value like Equity could or any other asset could so backup it's like a yeah it's like a safety net but how much do you think gold has given a return over the last many years give a guess 10 yeah it's actually not bad 9 and 9 something per for the last 40 years which is not bad considering it's a safe heaven for many people because they think gold is gold so as a hedge also so and as a value of an investment which goes up over a period of time not bad so apart from fds if there's something that parents keep on talking about it's gold so what's the whole fuss about why do you think our parents talk about gold so much returns and do you think they love weddings I I love weddings it's interesting it's actually a in being Indian mhm 11 to 12% of all the gold in the world is owned by Indian households so if not physical gold I can get into digital gold that's enough but then we have gold mutual fund also we have ETF also we have S gold B also wasn't all of this supposed to be very simple why do you keep complicating it I'll be honest I do think it's a little complicated so what's an easy way to figure this out you tell me what to invest in I'll invest no what we'll do is we'll quickly go through all of the types we'll do the pros and cons but that's really boring so we'll do it like this I'm going to give you chart you're going to put red flag green flag based on what seems nice the one which has the the most green is good for you the one which has the most red is not good I just have to guess no I'll give you the information you can ask questions and we'll keep it super simple quiz time yes and if you don't want to watch this you can skip to the end to see which wins but that would be cheating instead you should pause and tell me which one do you think works and I'll magically get a spreadsheet on it very nice this is a physical version of that spreadsh and this is green flag so here's what we'll do option one we can go through each of these items in full detail spending 5 minutes each to understand accessibility risk the cost the liquidity and make a 1 hour long video does that sound good no I don't have the time we don't have the time we'll finish this really quickly and I'm going to first explain each of this so physical gold is what gold digital gold is what digital gold it's digital gold so you don't really possess it but you own something which represents a physical gold placed somewhere and you can actually take POS verion of it if you like H so it's 99.9% Purity gold ETF uh you can get them through a broking app yeah correct so you open a broking app it's listed you can buy it and it's easy then you have gold mutual fund which is just like an equity mutual fund which invests in Gold ETFs only but they mix like one or two or three different ETFs and they basically it's a fund but there's a professional fund manager sitting behind it also that's nice and then it's sgb what's that no idea sgb sovereign gold bonds Sovereign means from the government of India bonds means it's debt so the government is essentially taking a loan from you in exchange to give you a return uh which is which I'll explain later and uh they basically price it at the price of gold okay so it's not actually backed by gold but because it's guaranteed by the government uh it's fine so sgb so it tracks gold basically now you tell me is accessibility wise rate it red flag green flag green because you can just buy it from any Shop digital gold green okay because you can just buy it from an app gold ETF green buy it from a broking app gold mutual fund buy it from some mutual fund app sgb you can ask me if you don't know where can you buy this so sgbs are not available all the time they have a duration where they're available you go bid and you take it and then they're not available for a period like right now at the time of shooting this there is no sgb available because the government hasn't made it available oh so it's not as accessible here so yeah okay red red flag got it all right so now let's talk about uh the risks so let's see physical gold the risks are what it get stolen so digital gold actually perfectly fine the only slight risk here is that it's not regulated by RBI and sebi as much right now so it's going to be a 3D flag yeah it's a little bit of both it's Medium as far as I know there have not been issues with it so far but little since you're talking about risk with gold ETF the prices move there could be a liquidity issues which means if there's no buyer or seller on the other side you won't be able to trade it so that's sort of like a little bit risk apart from that um it's actually all right so and gold mutual fund is the same thing because it's investing right here so I mean so longterm not really that risky is it just like at one day if you want to take it out and you have no you can yeah and then we have sgbs the risk with sgbs are actually uh nil when it comes to tracking gold or anything okay now we'll move on to the next option which is minimum investment gold price right now I bought this so I'm 73,000 R per 10 G is what it costs 73,000 rupes for 10 G Plus other costs so I would say physical gold the minimum would be the highest so I'd say red I say red okay yeah fine you say digital gold is the simplest uh bunch of people are investing online and they are able to back it with actual gold somewhere so they accept even one rupee as uh an investment so that's easily the minimum so it's green so minimum investment in Gold ETF is like one unit one unit is about 70 75 rupes that's not bad it's not bad so I think it's I think it's great also one thing about physical gold that we didn't cover is that people do buy 1 G 5 G unless the jewelry shop forces you and says but yeah so but I don't know if you want to keep that green and red also gold mutual funds are the same as gold ETS they have an nav this could be say 100 rupees affordable yeah sgbs is a minimum of 1 G which is about 7,300 7,500 so you need to decide what you think about oh really but 7,000 is okay no no okay fine cool let's start with costs now but gold is gold it's going to be the same it should right yeah the cost of gold is gold and then it should be the same for physical gold yes digital gold and traded gold correct yeah but let's figure this out physical gold me you have to go to a shop and buy so they charge a you know this making cost making charge so that's about let's say 7 to 12% that's true 7 to 12% I'll say it again 7 to 12% that is very high that's pretty high there is GST so the GST takes away another 3 % now all this gold you will keep in your drawing room right Locker you keep Locker so the locker will charge something so it is a cost right yeah and it's a recurring cost so you're paying every year the next we have digital gold I can see over here that we have 3% GST charged okay and then with the app that you buy it from keeps a spread between the actual cost of gold and what it's selling to you it's allowed and that spread is what they uh charge is different for everyone so let's say it's 3% okay so they have 3% plus 3% 6% is what your you're paying then we have gold ETF now gold ETF charges an expense ratio okay this is 5% to 75% so far that's the lowest with gold mutual funds it's roughly the same about5 to 75% now of course apart from this there'll be demat charges there'll be some brokerage you'll pay bare minimum but those are costs let's talk about sgbs sgbs there is no expense ratio you buy it directly um in fact the government gives you 2 and 1 half% because every bond has a coupon it gives you 2 and a half% every year on that and it tracks gold so the same as Gold Plus 2.5 yeah and then you pay the dmat charges because you hold it in a DM account and actually that's it so what do you think physical gold physical gold uh what was it huh making charges crazy all taxes digital gold was 6% I remember so I'd say I'd mark it like a green and red both okay cuz like and then gold ETF was like really less point5 to plus generally 5% yeah same goes here and this also like plus only so over here sgb wins clearly and then we have finally liquidity so we have liquidity for physical gold very simple you go to a shop and you say you're able to buy it so is it liquid yes do you get the best price questionable so I would still say green can you sell it easily yes you can Fair digital gold is the most liquid you can do this immediately and the money also comes back immediately so this is green green gold ETF um is also fine but some gold ETFs actually have liquidity issues which means there are less people buying and selling oh so you may not get the best price so I would say it's not that bad but yeah maybe like a maybe like a moderate 3D is the new moderate 3D is the new moderate and then you have um gold mutual funds so I think this would also be 3D but it'll be decided on a nav so that's why the fund manager exists to manage this and then you have sgbs the thing with sgbs is let's say it's a 8e long Bond you will actually exit once it matures so I would say red red FL yeah so if you wait to mature then it's fine but yeah so that's it so what are you going to pick I think over here I might go for either gold ETF or gold mutual fund so Tanya why are you doing all this to get rich correct I think everyone wants to buy gold eventually they have enough gold so they feel rich it's like Uncle Scrooge who used to dive inside this huge wall full of coins and actually take his morning bath in it because it made him feel secure made him feel and I'm okay but that entire episode of DuckTales which is a long time ago was about him spending time with his grandchildren going to exotic places solving things and then coming back and enjoying some drinks with him mocktails only so maybe the wealth was not those coins maybe it was something else I wonder what you think which of these modes makes sense and do you even think gold makes sense tell us in the comments below say something nice and see you in the next shorts [Music]",

    "transcript_full": "why are we paying for all these subscriptions I did some really deep research to find some crazy things of why we paying every single month when we've already paid for the product and the last thing over here will blow your freaking mind the OG subscription business is a probably your panala the dudwala and your newspaper guy and what's wrong with it we've been doing doing it for many many many years the difference is now the subscription has grown from the physical space to the digital space and here is what we found something interesting it's about a new company which taught us a new way to pay for a service Salesforce Salesforce was selling software before it people would basically buy the software and own the freaking software Salesforce changed this they had a pay as you go model for any Enterprises and they renamed it to software as a service SAS since the Salesforce explosion businesses and subscription models have been in sort of like a love affair more and more business categories are actually exploring subscription Services as a business model and the math is mathing in 2020 the subscription economy was worth 650 billion and in 2025 it's expected to be around 1.5 trillion these businesses know how to give you free trials hop on their ride and the most famous OG trick make you feel special special is ironic because more and more people are moving towards subscriptions and they're actually just a statistic so over here what we found was interesting you can see here in every single category you have people interested in subscription like clothing and fashion you can also see household groceries and the cost of subscriptions per month for say e-learning is 700 rupees gaming is 550 Wellness is 553 even Music Services command 400 rupees a month but what happens when the subscription traps innocent people in the name of convenience imagine spending thousands of rupees on a printer on the ink cartridges on the electricity and then you can't use the printer and the reason it's not printing says payment method needs updating my partner I got a new printer and it just wouldn't print at all cannot print with the installed cartridge the ink is completely full I replaced it like last week this is a real story about an actual HB printer user he's not allowed to use a third party ink cartridge and has to use the expensive ones sold by the company if the ink is low then you can't use facts or scanning which has nothing to do with ink and the worst part is if you cancel the ink cartridge subscript description the entire printer becomes unusable why our goal was to reduce the number of what we call unprofitable customers that makes actual no sense and it's not just your printer it's other products too like a fitness band which costs 25 26,000 Rupees allows you to use its product for a full year after which you've got to buy a subscription to use the exact same product but now you're paying for the Analytics and everything else because all your data is there it's basically selling your data back to you and the one car companies use are even funnier no I really mean it so in the UK it's really cold obviously it's a cold country so people want heated seats a person who's bought a BMW car and owns that car actually has to pay a subscription for heated seats and Toyota even introduced a subscription for key fobs for a remote start there's even a case where Mercedes is charging a subscription fee for faster acceleration guys someone's bought the product why you putting stuff like this behind a paywall but you know the crazy bit when you actually own it and you have to pay a little bit more you sort of do end up paying a little bit more and then some companies give you free access to their product with a free trial now you'll say there's nothing wrong with a free trial and that isn't but wait till I tell you a story I remember a time when you would go online sign up for a trial and if you didn't like it you just abandoned it and nothing would happen but not now now they'll take your credit card and you'll forget about the credit card because the trial period is just long enough and if you forget to cancel they'll freaking charge you has it ever happened to you you forgot about canceling your subscription and you were charged so let's talk about Spotify Spotify is one of those apps which is used for Passive usage which means you'll do it while you're running cooking you're driving basically you're not actively using the app now the great thing about a passive app is that you do it with your existing habits so if you go to the gym in the morning you might get used to using the Spotify playlist during your gym or maybe when you're driving home or some part of your habits Spotify knows this so it's given a 3mon long trial with all of its capabilities you start to use it and after the 3 months they withraw those exact same features which was making your life amazing and now you got to pay for it even if it's a low amount in India users can't play songs in a specific order repeat songs or tab back to their previous songs and these features will instead only be available to premium subscribers I think it's a great app but it's a little sneaky trick a lot of companies are using at a couple of bucks a day it's not a lot but now you're addicted and you got to pay the subscription forever let's take OT for an example and here we can see India's growth on OT is out running the average this is enabled by the internet and UPI and sustained with a little thing called UPI autopay like if I open my phone right now I can check that my Netflix autopay on UPI set to 2053 it means that till 2053 Netflix can continue to withdraw from my account its amount if I don't hit the cancel button how convenient for them and you know what's interesting it's affecting people in a deep scarring way you you come here come here come here come here lambu this is lambu Amar he looks after sound he's getting engaged next year and his auto pay just renewed Tinder so what's basically Happening Here is that they're trying to take a maximum amount from the user without any additional services that they're giving to them and the problem here is not even that it's actually that your choice is being taken away from you as a consumer in a capitalist Society according to Adam Smith the most important power each one of us have is that we get to vote which company wins and which loses with the choices that we make from the products that we choose to buy but if that choice is taken away from us it's no longer Fair like the bundling issue sometimes you've bought a certain service and they give you a bunch of free services as well which are also subscriptions signed you up and sometime in the future it may Auto renew they're taking away your choice then there's the case of overlapping Services you may buy 1 2 3 four Music Services because you forgot the other one is automatically Auto renewing especially if the amount is really really low I know sometimes 100 rupes may not matter to someone but why would you pay for something you're not actually using and this is why people are sick and tired of subscriptions like covered in this article beautifully and I'd love to show you this article but I can't because this article is behind a freaking pay wall and you need a subscription it's so weird it's made it to Reddit where people are talking about this it's kind of crazy but the best thing about a subscription business is that you can opt out press the cancel button exit leave and I found something crazy that blow your mind when you want to cancel it's bad for the business maybe it's what you want but not what the business wants I want you to see this example of adore me when a customer would go to buy something over there normally to shop just once they would automatically convert that customer into a subscription paying customer without their consent so even if they didn't buy anything the next month they would still pay a subscription amount that's crazy and once they found out and had to cancel it they would show weird things like store credits and deter you from actually cancelling you see the subscription model is absolutely fine but these dark patterns is taking away a choice and definitely is deceitful the root of all of this is convenience UPI autopay is making things easier for these guys meanwhile we are writing an entire thesis on cancellation flows I'm not kidding check this out it's called The Iliad flow and the flow basically talks about how you have to go through multiple dock patterns screens to actually just cancel in fact in an Amazon Prime cancellation flow you have to go through three different screens to actually cancel and in all these screens there are 70 dark patterns we actually counted it and this research paper even dissected every single page of course they have to protect their business but why make it so hard for you to cancel and some companies won't even let you cancel after this making it even harder saying send us an email and someone will call you or speak with you before you can actually cancel back in the day we used to do this with gym memberships they used to take a whole Year's worth of money and then they just didn't let you cancel like this crazy Hotel Collection diffuser proudly on its FAQ page says you're not allowed to cancel the average cancellation flow anywhere on the internet has about 6.2 dark patterns including cute pandas and puppies then we looked through the internet to find a tool that can find all of our subscriptions so we can easily cancel them and we did this magic tool also has a subscription so we can cancel other subscriptions oh my God what is wrong with you internet now there are some fixes the government is trying to bring new regulations to actually fix all these things like Merchants must disclose all these Norms before the autopay is happening and even in India there was an autopay reset just a while back and I'm sure in time we'll find a solution 20 years ago when you bought something you actually owned it today because you want unlimited songs unlimited movies unlimited everything you pay for a subscription and you end up owning nothing the question is do you really own it or does the subscription own you",

    "title_current": "Why Gold prices are falling NOW",
    "transcript_full": "Gold has moved up 24% in the last 4 months. It's only gold that is glittering right now. What is going to be the trajectory going forward? How high could they go? The historic run on gold and it just hit 1 lakh rupees. On one side, experts are saying that it could go to 1.2 lakhs or even more. But on the other side, we have analysts saying it'll fall 38%. Is this the start to a massive bull run that has just begun or will we pause and fall? And what should you do? So, we'll answer whether you should actually buy more gold, you should actually hold on, or you should just wait because the market seems like it may fall. I'm sorry for my voice, but that won't stop me from actually explaining this. You know, every time the market goes up in gold, there are two kinds of people who emerge. One who say that this is just the beginning, it'll go up forever. And second, the kind of person who says don't forget 2012. So in 2012 you can see that just before this the market had gone up a lot and then we went sideways for some time and then the market sort of just drifted 2012 13 14 15 you can even include a little bit of 16 and 17 because nothing really happened back then and the rise only happened 2019 onward. But if you zoom out a 100 years, you'll see that gold has seen war, inflation, global resets and god knows what all that has happened around the world. Yet overall over a period of time it has gone up. So it always thrives in chaos in the long term. So the question is what is the chaos of 2025? We have the Russia, Ukraine, Israel, Middle East tensions happening and now we have the US and China tariff wars happening. We have the USD currency fluctuations and even qualitative surveys like this where consumer confidence in the economy has actually fallen. Whenever people stop trusting economies and the government, immediately they stop thinking about growing their money and people think about gold as safety, right? I mean mom has gold in her locker not because she wants a return from it because it makes her feel safe. It makes you feel safe. Think about 2008. In 2008, markets fell down around the world and you even had gold falling. But after that, for the next few years, gold went up 150%. When people are scared, they put money in gold. Remember this one point. It'll help us answer those three questions. But right now, the scenario is different. We have Trump's equation. That's literally the equation the government is using to figure out how much tariff to tariff who. And we asked the team to find out what's this talk about recession and this is what they came up with. There's an inverted yield curve. There is survey data. There is analyst data. Everyone saying that the government is likely to trigger a recession in the US which could trigger a global recession. Now the point is that I have all the data here and you can see it but there's no point in going through it. What we must understand is these three questions. How does this affect us? The takeaway is this. If a recession happens, gold will actually perform. If a recession doesn't happen, well, it'll probably flatline or do nothing. But do you think we can predict whether a recession will happen or not? If we could, these analysts would probably have consensus and they don't. Maybe the answer is not in all of these global cues and what's happening in India. So, let's analyze what's happening here. You know, in 1991, India had become bankrupt. In fact, we didn't have any money to import even 3 months worth of imports. That means we could not run our country. So, we did what any household mother would do. We pawned the gold. We took around 47 tons of gold, put it on an aeroplane and sent it to London. This actually happened. And in London, once that gold was received, we received a borrowing. It was a loan but we got cash. Gold was our safety net in 1991. Gold is your safety net too. It's inside the Indian psyche. We have gold in the locker. Worst case, we will be saved. The RBI, our central bank owns about 879 tons of gold and I think it's about 11% of our total forex reserve. The FM states that the government is not buying gold to replace a currency. So why is she saying that? Because the USD is actually the reserve currency of choice of the world. This is a systemic risk. If something happens to that one currency, entire economies could be affected. So a lot of central governments are hedging by having a diversified portfolio internationally by having gold because at the end of the day, gold will still have value. But there's another interesting thing. I mean, all of us don't buy gold. We buy jewelry, right? like the jewelry that you have in the locker, the family heirloom. But what's happening? Something really changed. From 2021 to 2024, gold jewelry demand, the jewelry, right, used to be 610 tons and in 2024 it's 563 tons. This may not look like a very big difference, but it's stagnant or falling. However, if you look at people investing in gold online through ETFs, in 2022, the total gold ETF was 460 crores. And in 2024, it's 9,224 crores. I mean, that's a massive jump. This also means that people still believe gold works and gold is safe. But the mode of acquiring gold is changing. India and a friend of mine actually messaged me yesterday saying if markets fall gold will be as a hedge because when markets fall gold will go up and when markets go up gold will go down. Correct? No. A lot of people think gold is safe, gold is hedge. Correct? But they also think when markets go up, gold goes down. When market goes down, gold goes up. This common belief that gold and equity always move in opposite directions is not entirely true. Between 2006 and 2024, there are only a few years where gold went up and equities went down or vice versa. In most years, both actually moved in the same direction. So no, gold isn't always the opposite of equity. It's more complicated than that. AB, I know what you're thinking. Put all these things together. Gold is the perfect asset class. Nope, it's not. We'll play a game. Okay. Here I have a bunch of data and you have to give me a reaction. From 1980 to 1989, gold gave how much return? Pause. The answer is 0%. Let's play again. From 1996 to 2002, gold gave how much return? Pause the video. I hope you guessed it right. 0%. And then from 2012 to 2019, I know you're not going to pause the video, it was also 0%. However, if you look at these spots over here, these periods, it gave a fantastic return. And this is exactly what happens on the internet. When you go online and when you see gold going to 1 lak rupees, the only story you actually want to believe is that gold will keep going up forever. No asset class will ever keep going up forever. In fact, the same thing is true for equity as well. So here we can see Sensex returns. It doesn't matter how much the return is. All you need to do is actually check how large the bar is over here. Amazing return. Amazing return. Amazing return. Amazing return. Amazing return. If you looked at the market just here and invested, your expectation would be here and then next year you would have got nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing. But this is also not true that when this happens that equity is very bad. You know this is an oversimplification that equity is good, gold is bad. The truth is you want to own some equity, you want to own some fixed deposit or some fixed income, some bonds. You want to own some actually let me just use this some gold because you really don't know when the market will go up. And I also want to add another asset class here and I'll do it like this. I'll call it real estate. And I have some real estate data over here. Certain years from 2002 to 2007, real estate was going up like crazy. And then we had certain years like 2017 when it wasn't. You know when an asset performs really well like gold is doing right now. We feel phobe. Phobi is fear of being invested. Market if the market falls then what? And then if you're not invested then we feel for that I did not invest. What if it goes up more? In both cases whether you're invested or not invested you will feel fear. So let's answer these three questions now shall we? The first question is, should you buy gold right now? Well, if you're thinking about a really long period based on all what I told you, what do you think? I think you should prepare to start investing slowly and have some exposure to gold. Don't go all out. The next is do you think the market will fall from here? So, should I wait before I invest? No. We don't know whether the market will go up or down. But it's important to start even if it's very very small. And the habit of doing this for a long term is what will win. Not this one move whether the market will go up or not. Nobody knows where gold will go. And third, if the market falls, should I buy a lot? Absolutely not. Your job is to make sure you have little bit of money in all kinds of assets. And if you have the habit of investing in them in a long time, you will win. Remember, systems win over a reaction on what happens to markets. Let that sit for some time in your",

    "transcript_full": "I have a promise for you the promise of an unlimited life a life where you can live on your own terms not go to office do that trip buy that car without ever fing have to do another job I'm talking about the fire movement this movement is happening across the world and you should know your number because you control your life yes so how do you get that number follow the link in the description join my telegram Channel I will tell you how to get there so you can you know quit that job okay something was definitely wrong with that calculation does that fire number even exist so in this video we're going to talk about fire we're going to talk about the good and the bad cuz certainly the internet may be exaggerating things let's begin here's a story you get up make your breakfast brush your teeth go to the office speak to your manager do the attendance tell him what works you did meet your people at the water cooler have your lunch go back home repeat repeat repeat repeat for the rest of your life and every March hopefully you'll get an appraisal this prison that all of us think is a prison we all want to retire from and therefore we got this new imaginative thing called the fire financial Independence retire early now how could you possibly not do this routine and still live your life maybe if you had a c and that Corpus invested somewhere gives some kind of return and that return is possibly a little more than my expenses then I don't need to work right you can also imagine this as a crossover point at some point your savings your Investments are growing and giving you an Roi and your expenses are mostly the same at some point the ROI from your corus will cross the expenses you have and now you don't have to work so now all we need to do is find this fire number so here's what we have a sheet to calculate your fire number which is this annual expenses divided by 4% so let's say you live in a Metro City along with your family and your annual expenses come out to be roughly 10 lakh rup a year you have to insert 10 lakhs in the formula and now you know you'll need 2.5 crores Corpus and all your problems will be solved you never have to work again but wait where does that 4% even come from why did we even use it now let's talk about the 4% s sir the 01 Fest not right I'm rolling I'm rolling but the missions I have to talk about not in front of everyone no no sir it's going to be epic this thing no no no no Fest no Fest right now people use the 4% rule because it's an easy guide for how much to take out each year from your retirement savings and it's also believed to be the basis of the fire number this rule came about by analyzing Bond returns from 1926 to 1976 times have changed a lot and 4% as a thumb rule is definitely not right you know why because inflation is different from 1990s to 20124 return profiles are different and I also think patient levels are different now again going back to the Excel sheet I have annual expenses written here as 10 lakhs I have the safe withdrawal rate of 4% I have a fire number but let's scroll a little down now obviously when you have 250 lakh rupees you invest this amount assuming the ROI to be 10% let's see what happens to our corpus now we've put this all in an Excel sheet and all we need to know is if we start at 35 with this fire number what happens once we say 70 so if I scroll all the way down age 77 the Corpus still has 27 CR rupees let me say this again once you have this fire number by the time you're 77 you will still have 27 CR rupees count despite accounting for inflation ha life I won B wait a minute tell it how you live it 10 to okay is this actually true let me have a look at the Excel sheet so the Excel sheet is assuming that every year the ROI is 10% do you think your expenses will be the same next year and you'll add 6% maybe next to next year maybe but let's practically think in this example we've gone from age 35 to 77 that's probably like three lifetimes from 35 to 45 will the expenses really be the same do you think at age 45 the expense profile will change or will the children grow up and want to go to the Harvard equivalent in 200000 whatever it is do you think at 55 it'll change it will it's life every 10 years everything about your life changes and because of this your expense profile Chang ches this is called lifestyle inflation this fire calculator doesn't account for that it assumes a straight line that the expenses will increase only about 6% a year which is not how life works also 6% inflation is a generalized term for the entire country but it differs from locality to state region inflation comes in many different forms and at this point you should probably look back and see the last three or 5 years what were the expenses you're doing now that you weren't doing then add up all those expenses and you see that your costs have added up because your life has changed what was your lifestyle inflation this year that wasn't there 3 years ago put in the comments we'll have a nice laugh next let's talk about longevity longevity longevity means we're assuming we will live till X but we could actually live more I mean who thought someone would want to live more in this life pain but actually because of healthare we might actually live longer so assuming that retirement and there is an end date of 7 7 what if you live for an extra 10 years huh I don't want to sound bad but come on and if you're thinking you'll get a job at 77 you won't ch7 another thing you should be careful about are unexpected events you know we've been running this company for 6 years now and we started building 01 a year ago and I am obsessed with taking control of my life there I said it on this episode and that's why I naturally make lists about everything lists about work I want to do today list about work I want to do this week this quarter this year now the problem with this is that many times the lists don't check out something else happens in life so I started creating an anti- list you know what the anti list is the anti list is stuff good stuff that happened in our lives that wasn't planned for and I've been doing the anti list for 6 months now and this is what my actual list looked like for the last 6 months and this is the anti list the anti list is much larger than what was planned for but the opposite also happens unexpected events that are negative financially may happen so if on this fire calculation you've not accounted for legal cases medical emergencies maybe someone really needs the cash Etc that also may be a mistake you will not have straight expenses straight inflation straight Roi life is full of bumps and dumps and whatnot so somehow you should plan for an emergency fund which is much larger than your normal and maybe that'll settle down the bumps a little bit more so the question is if the normal fire calculation is wrong then what is well good old Excel I'll open the Excel sheet over here you can go to the description open it click on file make a copy and make these changes first put in your annual expense put in a safe withdrawal that you actually think makes sense now that you understand why 4% doesn't fire number you will get automatically calculated for Roi imagine what an Roi is actually true nift is given 12% you should assume way way lower than that and your starting age is 35 change up these numbers exaggerate it a bit to figure out what your final number may be around but I have one more thing about this and that's about your expenses the only thing within your control is actually your EXP ense your career progression how much money you make all these things are actually not in your control so the first thing you should do if you really want Financial Independence is figure out what part of your expense can you remove today so your life is slightly better in the future and the third is something even more interesting but I need someone to take this laptop away from me it is this and it's going to be the most powerful thing I ever told you open up a new dock or find a new Fresh crisp piece piece of paper and write an essay the essay is going to be one pager of what your one day looks like or one week looks like after you've achieved your financial Independence now let's suppose it's 2 CR rupees and you've actually hit it I want you to write down right now what will your first week or one typical week look like this is just a catch you can't talk about a holiday you can't talk about buying something you can't talk about a house a car blah blah blah and you can't basically talk about anything materialistic that you have to buy you have to talk about your normal routine what time do you get up how do you go to work what exactly do you do you do at your work how do you come back Etc and that is what real life is real life is routine remember when we were in school we were told ke when you grow up and get to class 5 pen use you can use a pen till then you have to use a pencil then one day after you graduated from 4 to 5th you could use a pen wasn't that amazing you felt like an adult right remember just using a pen writing that date writing the title you felt older it was amazing that was a moment of glory and today if I give you a pen or a pencil you wouldn't really care right does it really matter if using a pen or a pencil does it really the car the house the going out are all pens and you think that one day once I get that pen I'll have that moment of Glory but the truth is real life is in the monotony of routine and if you can find a way to enjoy Diwali go out have fun enjoy the summer that's really what life will be about in the longer run let me know what you thought about this video and see you in the next episode",

    "transcript_full": "don't do an sip everyone on the internet and a bunch of my friends are saying they've been doing this for 5 years and are not getting results strategy so we have two strategies over here that are an alternative to Sips we'll compare them and find out which one is actually better the point is very simple when you're making linear progress every time this dot goes up you feel amazing you feel like you're making progress but life is mostly three steps forward and two steps back and the stock market is no different when you see lots of lows you can't continue sip because well the Market's falling how can you put more money into the market that makes no logical sense and most people stop investing in fact all of this is rooted in real data in a consultation paper by sebbi over here you can see in the first 2 years of anyone holding a mutual fund a regular plan 73% people quit and by the fifth year 9 7% people have quit and only 3% have survived most people quit because of all of this happening and you can see in this table that more and more people are starting their sips but at the same time people who've discontinued is 4X of it people don't have the discipline to do sip regularly so your behavior is actually dependent on the market cycle but if it's so dependent on the market cycle then maybe we could try a strategy which has lumpsum in it and see if there's a lumpsum versus sip strategy here I have a chart over here from October 2008 to October 2015 I'm cherry picking this period because it has something very interesting the market did this it just went up now over here if you compare an sip versus a lumpsum who do you think wins think about it the lumpsum investment if you invest one lakh over here in in one shot and the market doubles that one lakh has become 2 lakhs but if I did an sip version of it then my entry would be here here here here here here here because I'm averaging the entry every single month for all of this time so therefore my entry point will be somewhere in the mid and because of that it won't be 100% return it'll be much much less so in the case of a bull run a lumpsum always wins but in the case of a volatile Market where the market went down a lot then went up Etc the Sip wins so which is better we don't actually know we don't know if the market is going to be volatile a bull market or a bare Market if we knew then B but there may be a clue in this strategy we're going to talk about so first I'll show the case of a normal regular Sip and the returns that you'll get you have to understand every part of this properly because then we'll tweak it in the actual strategy we're going to start with January 2014 all the way to January 2025 so it's exactly 10 years we're going to assume you're investing 10,000 rupes a month and we have mapped the spot amount for nifty50 over here according to that month and based on this invested amount 10,000 rupees you get number of units this sip gives you about 12.64% return let's change this a bit think about it 10 years ago you're investing 10,000 then in 2024 you're also investing 10,000 like are you so bad at your job that you're not getting a raise of course you are so please use that raise and every year increase that sip amount it can't be 10,000 right so over here the Step Up is 10% now of course you can change this number to 5% or 4% or 6% whatever you're comfortable with but I'll choose a nice round 10% so if you did 10,000 in the first year every month in the second year you'll do 10,000 + 10% 11,000 so this Excel sheet obviously calculates this entire thing and I can see the xirr is 12.83% slightly more than the normal sip think about that for a moment the normal sip did about 12.64% and the second one did 12.83% can you tell me why basically you were investing more money when the markets were actually in a bull run so if the markets were not in a bull run in the last few years this xir would have actually changed now the actual strategy is a normal sip but there's a Twist The Twist is simple when the market Falls you invest a little bit more so let me put some numbers to this let's suppose if Nifty fell by 2% then you will basically add 3x of your existing sip as a lump suum and if it falls 5% you'll invest 6X now you can change these numbers but I'm curious to know when a fall happens and you do a lump sum and the Sip is also running would that return improve over here you can see that the market corrected by 3.56% which is more than 2% so you will do 10,000 C 3x that's 30,000 rupes so 10,000 + 30,000 is how much you'll invest that month and that month's investment reflects here at 40,000 number of units obviously will increase total units increase and it affects your total portfolio value now this also rewies your brain in such a way that if the market is going up AA if the market falls down the AA because then you have an opportunity to invest and right here the xir is 13.07% but let's try our final strategy this time every year we'll add a step up so we won't just invest 10,000 in the first year second year it'll be 11,000 so on so forth let's see what happens over here I'll scroll all the way down you can see the returns over here is about 13.3% the highest among all but there's a problem these numbers are actually not right let me explain the problem is that we looking back in time and trying to project our future and we forget why we are investing in you are investing for only two reasons one so you feel safe and second so you feel safe this is the actual function of money if you look at this strategy there is an assumption the assumption is that you have that extra cash to invest in this lumpsum when the opportunity presents itself and the second assumption is that you'll actually do that step up and that sip with discipline every month for the next 10 years it is assumes you have a safety net you have an emergency fund because in 10 years good things and bad things can happen and you'll manage that separately but this won't break your real wealth is probably not in your bank balance but actually what skill you bring to the table when you go to office and work the salary that you earn and how fast you actually learn how many rich people do you know who own a house but don't have time to stay in it because they're at their shop worrying about when their next piece of Revenue will happen and how much profit they'll make a lot of people convert this money table into a worry habit and they forget they started investing to make their dreams possible and be actually stressfree now the problem with this data is that it's looking back at a time which will never ever happen in the future you won't have the exact same 2008 again you won't have the exact same Bull Run and because of these biases in the data suddenly one of these strategies does well if I were to just change any of these events suddenly some other strategy would do well and then you would think that's good for you the only thing that actually makes sense is you invest as a habit and the returns take care of themselves because you don't know what the future will hold",

    "title_current": "The New Way of investing in Real Estate | De-influencing",
    "transcript_full": "here is your chance to own real estate commercial real estate I'm talking about shops hotels and all this commercial property including the offices you see behind you remember as an owner you're entitled to 90% of the earnings of this new thing called REITs real estate investment trusts you know they function just like mutual funds and these companies buy different kinds of income generating real estate and 90% is given back to you and the beauty is you can start with just rupees 500 amazing now you don't need to invest cror of rupees anymore and you can become an owner so think about this whether you're looking at commercial property re commercial property re commercial property re it's the same thing guys guys guys REITs are not so simple I mean there's an obvious connection between between real estate property and REITs but they're not exactly the same so in true influencing style today we're going to talk about the good the bad about REITs because these guys clearly won't so hit that like And subscribe and let's start with Point number one [Music] now if you buy a physical property you're basically looking at two types of returns one is that the physical property itself the value increases over a period of time so basically you buy a commercial property of say 1 CR rupees and the value of that commercial property goes up to say 2 cror this is called capital appreciation the second type of return you're looking at as an investor is the interest payment or in this case the rental income now once someone occupies that place there is a monthly income that tenant pays you and that is a second source of income but the problem with this is that one you need a large Capital to start with 1 2 3 maybe even five crores and two you have to manage the actual property now this is where REITs come into the picture a Reit is like a mutual fund so a mutual fund basically collects money from various investors and pulls it in a central location now this Central Pool invests in equity in debt in gold and other assets classes Reit functions the same way it collects money from various investors puts it in a pool and then invests it in different income generating properties now remember I said income generating so this could be a hotel which generating some income this could be a shops generating some income it could even be office space generating some income this income is collected by the Reit and according to se's rules 90% of the income generated the net is actually given back to the investors that's You So when you buy a Reit you will log into a broking account add it just like an equity stock over there and you can buy it now when you do this you don't get a flat in your name you actually get units just like a mutual fund and the units represent ownership in that pool of assets now there are two ways you will earn from these units one is that there's capital appreciation which means the value of those units can go up second a dividend is paid through the earn earnings that the reat generates through these properties and that's paid to you just like a physical property but maybe there is some difference between them because on the outside on the surface it feels like they're both the same but are they let's find out and REITs have been around for a while they're not particularly new in the world from the 1960s we've seen REITs grown from that to this and many different companies have actually adopted REITs as an asset in their country even India for that matter you can also see the number of listed reads around the world has just increased from the '90s all the way to the 2000s so obviously there is some interest from investors to participate in this kind of asset class now if you Google re advantages on the internet the internet will tell you you get re advantages like low ticket size you can buy all this real estate and not have to worry about spending lots of money a few thousand rupees and you're in second you get exposure to a new asset class Equity Equity debt you can get real estate with a low amount of money the third thing is that you get a guaranteed 90% of the returns that they generate into your account isn't it amazing isn't it beautiful and property and you don't even have to manage all of this some manager is doing it for you hasslefree easy low ticket size best isn't it but it's not there are a lot of misconceptions going around about REITs and there's nothing wrong with REITs globally and even in India REITs are fine I think the problem is of How It's marketed and the perception of people that rats are exactly the same as real estate on ground there are obvious differences and today we'll talk about what those differences actually are especially in our country in India so let's talk about the first misconception about REITs in India so look at this map you can see all the reats over here in America you can see all the reats over here on the Asian and the European and this side India just has four RS I mean and out of these four three are just office rats and one is the retail rate I mean that's not a lot but look globally there's so many different kinds of reads you have Logistics you have hotels you have all these different kinds and India neither has number of rats and it doesn't even have the types of rats it's still pretty new now everyone on the internet will tell you re brings diversification if you have Equity diversify out with the re to get real estate exposure now this overemphasis we have a problem with now think about this ultimately re are an equity instrument so saying it's just like real estate is wrong because real estate demand and supply has to do more with the location the Metro the people buying stuff there the school opening and a thousand other things so the exact comparison is not true another thing on the internet you'll find is people saying that since you're buying real estate property and property has no risk therefore REITs have no risk this is not true every asset class in the world no matter what we're talking about always carries risk and with REITs it it's particularly interesting now think about an investment company which owns a bunch of commercial properties it's getting money from you but it's also debt fin baned which means it borrows money from the bank here is the risk as interest rates go up the cost of borrowing goes up and therefore their profitability goes down very simply put as interest rates go up their profitability goes down so of course there's risk and this is completely normal I'm not saying this is a bad thing but you should just know what affects rats and you can see this in the US the interest rate environment is high and the rat index has hit a 14 years year low and even in India actually look at this chart this is the reat index it's completely flat so forget about capital appreciation is just not happening over here in fact out of the four reats listed three of them are below their IPO price so there's no capital appreciation so far of course you get those dividends but well yeah another thing you'll find on the internet is that 90% of all earnings will go to you there's a problem over here and it's this a real estate investment trust is a trust which means it's a company and the company actually has to earn a profit right just like any company there's nothing wrong with it so every time it earns something it'll first remove all its expenses so there'll be employee costs there'll be electricity there'll be all these costs a company has there'll also be a partner share of profits that he'll take now from that what's left is called the net earnings and of that 90% goes to you so it's not exactly like owning the commercial property yourself if you owned a shop you would get to keep everything in this case because a trust is managing it there is a fee a cost now is there anything wrong with this of course not it's fine and they must take their due for the work that they've done it's just that people don't talk about this part and of course we have fund of funds recently mutual funds are saying that you can invest in Diversified rats through their fund of funds basically a mutual fund investment is what you do and that mutual fund finds a bunch of Real Estate Investment Trust to invest not only in India but across the globe now fun of funds have two problems first people just don't understand it they don't understand REITs how will they understand a fund that invests in rits so there's low understanding of how funer fund works the second problem is AUM there is not a lot of money in these funds to actually replicate the index which is why when you look at the chart over here there's a huge tracking error and that's not good if you're investing in a fund it should track what it's supposed to track why is there so much of deviation so that's probably a problem in the short term until this becomes more popular and now is my favorite point that every reate cannot be analyzed with a single framework you can't just put it in some kind of screener and find out which which is the best reat let me tell you why the reason is that every reate functions a different way there could be a hotel reate there could be a retail reate there could be a logistics reate and it doesn't end it could even be a residential reate and every reate is different think about it for a moment if you look at say an office reat it may have 12 years an average of a lease but a retail property May function differently because it may not have a 12year lease it's lease could be only 6 years so the difference could be the weighted average of the leases but that's not where this ends it could also be how they earn their money if you look at an office property it'll basically have a rent pred decided in the lease agreement but in a shop many times there's a minimum guarantee and on top of that there is a revenue share based on sales so this means that their revenue will be a lot different and therefore the analysis for these types of rats if it's an office rate or a retail rate will be different we actually found this while listening to one of the investor calls right here where they mentioned it and to be honest this was really really surprising that yeah it makes sense every rate will have a different way now think about it how will the revenue model of a logistics re with warehouses work or something like a hotel or residential we're not saying REITs are good or bad all we're saying is before you do any investment in any asset class class ES understand the nuances and we thought having a misconception series like de influencing actually helps because we talk about how simple it is on what you see on the internet and then delve into the depths of it if you find this useful please tell us what else should we de influence our team works really really hard just look at this we're up since morning trying to figure this out and make this nice thing on Commercial Real Estate I hope you found it useful tell me your experience in the comments below and I'll see you in the next episode w",

    "transcript_full": "what's common between all these areas well they're called blue zones where people on average are said to live for one hundred years now compare this with other regions in the world where the life expectancy is just 74 years so what's behind this massive difference well unlike other places people living inside these blue zones don't consume processed foods often but think about what you ate last week processed foods have become a major part of people's diets across the world because of their irresistible taste dude it makes sense right i think it is not called processed food like i'm only thinking about this word now it is food french fry burger these all this is food right and i think in the last fifty years processed food has gone up 400% mhmm 400% that's it but i think i think from the time we last met i think you have started eating 400% more dude i'm not buying this stuff if you are saying that processed food has increased only 400% in the last fifty years i don't think that's true because i'm pretty sure fifty years back in india there was no processed food right yeah it's everywhere it's just everywhere but it makes sense right like french fries far more tastier than say it's not good for you so i can understand why a population would understand why we also like it you were also snacking on that plate over there it's definitely not good for you mhmm but i think it will be interesting to know when packaged food started being manufactured at an industrial scale incentive like history we've been processing food for over a million years with the earliest example is this guy some two point one million years ago the homo habilis one of the earliest known human species they had to cook meat to make it easier for chewing now this was followed by simple food preservation methods like drying smoking and salting which the early civilizations adopted then in the nineteenth century two important developments took place first french chef nicolas apert discovered something unbelievable he tried to preserve food in airtight bottles which came to be known as canning think about how many food items you take out of a can thank this frenchman one of the most popular use was during world war one when soldiers fighting in war needed quick food supplies which could last for days as the world went back to normal and people started upgrading their lifestyle the demand for packaged or processed food started booming and convenience became a preference over the hard labor of cooking who's gonna cook that shit when i can just open the can then in the eighteen sixties another frenchman invented pasteurization which became a breakthrough in preserving milk and other food items even today the milk you drink thank that frenchman seeing this companies saw an opportunity they could capitalize on the laziness of homo sapiens and started aggressively advertising ready to eat food cornflakes the leader is here with a bright new face a colorful ear of corn the old and and that became a staple part of modern american diet and it wasn't just the west alone which is enjoying the revolution india it was the beginning we also saw a number of processed food companies come up earliest among them were britannia and parley two companies founded long before world war two after the country became independent india too wanted convenience we wanted to get on with our daily work and make cooking well easy one of the most easiest processed food that became massively popular was this bread dude the interesting thing about india is the processed food which is the most famous which is bread i don't think it's just india alone right all over the world it's probably bread it's interesting right portuguese made it india mhmm so they brought in bread i'm guessing it was the wheat flour banana baked half of the vegetables in bombay i mean in maharashtra they still call it pau i think pau is a portuguese word yes for sure so i'm guessing when that when that bread happened it was not mass produced right there were small bakers who did it mhmm and quality was bad mhmm but let's think about your favorite packaged bread today mhmm and think about the manufacturer right perspective say he has to make sure three things brand marketing solid it should feel transparent and healthy that's why it has like transparent bags and or maybe it's just there to see the fungus if it's growing inside that's actually probably the real reason but anyway second it has to have a long shelf life mhmm i have a problem with that right so if something has a long shelf life it means that microorganisms bacteria are not attacking it and they are rejecting it so why are you eating something i mean yeah but anyway go on correct and i think the third thing is that nutritional value they have to do the fermentation get the right ingredients maybe put some nuts and other good stuff in it and that's expensive to scale if you put these three things in line the nutritional value of bread should be falling over a long period of time the bread that we see now dude even the brown bread i've heard a lot of the brown bread is not actually brown bread they just put dip it in molasses and it just looks brown yeah yeah this is a problem harmeetal even the bread is not nutritionally good for you it's just highly palatable yep apart from bread i think there's another addiction we have and that's like instant noodles mhmm i think it came in the eighties or nineties and we all love that chicken nostalgic right are you instant noodles not just instant noodles but over the years we have products like chocolates chips and even instant coffee with the global processed food market set to touch $3,400,000,000,000 that's 3,400 billion by 2030 that's a lot of food but despite being a trillion dollar market and widely consumed across the world processed foods contain some serious health risks especially today when it's become worse with ultra processed foods but what are ultra processed foods well when a food is made almost entirely by adding preservatives artificial sweeteners additives and other chemical substances they are called ultra processed big corporations like mcdonald's coca cola domino's and pepsico have built empires on ultra processed foods i think what really sucks also is that marketing companies say because essentially a lot of these companies are marketing companies okay let's face it they say that this is good for you and this is good for breakfast this is good for a snack and we believe it the vajanta actually believes it right no one really knows how to look at the nutritional label and understand another aspect which came to the limelight was breakfast it was the cereal companies who made breakfast the most important meal of the day breakfast and sugar make it different and wonderful a circus of fun to eat so you crinkle on down to the store for post sugar it all started with the physician who believed that eating a healthy breakfast was essential for good health and he said eat a breakfast that includes grains fruits and nuts to do a better job and it went on to create the first breakfast cereal since then the market has been flooded with sugary and colorful cereals like these and the saying was born breakfast is the most important meal of the day but that may not be true experts say that skipping breakfast may not really lead to weight gain or underperformance it's just a big lie peddled by the lobbyists so what can we do well for starters we can probably do is try to avoid any food that comes in bright colorful packages kept on the top shelves of supermarkets i think a general rule for health is if you don't know how it's made don't don't eat it don't go to a supermarket general don't go to a supermarket go to you may don't understand if anything is in a box you shouldn't buy it dude i was buying a packet of milk this morning real story oh sorry milk box exception but other boxes no but this milk i don't know tell me i don't know this milk said that it's homogenized milk it said that you do not need to refrigerate it for up to fifteen twenty days something like that mhmm and it will not spoil mhmm and all the bacteria has been removed mhmm that can't be good right or is it good i i don't know how to react to that when i read that it didn't sound right despite all these studies and advice from nutritionists and doctors the demand for processed food remains high and it makes sense right it's cheap and affordable and super quick to consume in fact if you look at middle income countries 50% of their dietary needs come from such food and as for their impact one study done in brazil by the american journal of preventive medicine showed that ten percent of deaths were contributed among the ages of 30 to 69 because of ultra processed food now think about the same effect in your country or in the us or in europe where the income disparity is so large that the lower income groups spend more money on getting their nutrition from ultra processed foods and the most common ingredient found in these kinds of foods is hfcs also known as high fructose corn syrup which along with sugar is regarded as one of the main reasons for the rise in obesity rates worldwide now big corporations know they can use fat high sugar and salt to create a recipe that will make your mouth salivate it's actually an unholy utility these three things do not occur in nature together ever so the body thinks oh my god jackpot jackpot at different points of time combination nature may exist nature may exist sugar plus salt sugar plus fat fat plus salt dopamine is just best best then you're addicted right no one can eat just now this isn't wrong because the big corporation is trying to optimize for sales and you are trying to optimize well for your primeval brain trying to figure out what to eat next and high sugar is just perfect but this isn't great for your health and we call this food engineering something that looks amazing tastes the best but is horrible for your health but some things are changing thanks to the internet consumers are smarter and they know what's good and bad for them and to serve this underserved market of the smarter consumer some companies are creating healthier snacks healthier food but the problem is healthier food just doesn't taste as well as engineered food and is slightly more expensive who will win in the end our salivating taste buds or our brain if you've liked the episode so far hit that like and subscribe and don't forget to comment this kind of food is gaining currency gaining traction because of the kind of lifestyle we have right so i'll i'll tell you an interesting thing right so when i was a college student i spent a significant part of my academic life in germany see and the interesting thing is so everybody thinks white people eat like you know junk food right that's not at all true european skin is fine it's just an american phenomenon nobody in europe make college students right college students eat healthy they cook like my classmates go to the supermarket buy vegetable not like the you know pesticide dude their food looks different food looks different food looks different food looks different the fruits are bigger the vegetables are greener right they bring it they cook at home they eat healthy food right and that's part of the reason is because they have the lifestyle which gives you enough time to do a slow living because if you look at india right india is a very aspirational country all of us need jobs we are always busy because we want to get ahead in life you wanna earn an extra doesn't allow us to do that you you want that extra nicer life right but because you need the extra nicer life you can't take a two hour lunch break french people have a two hour lunch break we don't have two hour lunch break french people probably commute with nicer public transport get home in fifteen minutes see at some point you have to understand the economic concept of marginal utility right see you have to understand that when slightly positive things happen your happiness goes up a lot for example if you move from a two bhk to three bhk your happiness goes up a lot but when wrong things happen right let's say you fall sick you get cancer or you get copd or you get one of those health you get diabetes or something so if you have diabetes right diabetes is a spectrum right diabetes hypertension they're all a spectrum they're all highly correlated diseases diabetes and hypertension makes you more susceptible to a spectrum of a number of diseases so if you work a couple of extras make your life better move from a one bhk to a b two bhk buy like a suv instead of a hatchback yes your delta happiness is increasing by plus 10 points plus 20 points something but if you get sick because you traded those number of hours to earn money rather than focus on your health you the downside which you get if you fall sick it'll be minus thousand minus 5,000 points abhis is easy for you to say now you could not have said this in your twenties this realization happens much later now if people can have that realization earlier that's a plus if you already have that realization it's not a bad idea to spread it to other people who are trying to become like you like see i'm i'm just so if somebody is watching it i'm saying that boss maybe i shouldn't have done it and now that i'm starting seeing you start on this path maybe don't do this like you know don't trade your life for anything i mean it's it's not worth it so i have a lot of friends who are practicing slow living because ultimately right people try to quantify your score with money or correct you know positions or something the unquantifiable thing is how happy you feel right for example i know a couple of a married couple friend of mine in bombay they just left the place they moved to himachal they you know forage they cut wood they go hunting wild fowl stuff like that they're incredibly happy incredibly healthy a lot of my friends moved to varkala in kerala they get up in the morning go surfing have local produce they don't have the goa lifestyle also they don't have so much money right but then the question is this right what are you going to do with it beyond a certain point like i mean it's it's it's not one of those tropes which say that money can't buy happiness that is a trope i completely you know dismiss it yeah but at some point you have to understand that what's the trade off now whether you get the time to cook or not processed foods are bad for your health and another thing which is making worse is the packaging material used to pack them for example plastic which is commonly used by big corporations contains a chemical compound known as bpa this creates hormonal imbalances in the body leading to diseases like pcos hyoid and even infertility and apart from plastic there's pfc i didn't know one thing though right before this show i was trying to research if like the packaging itself could be bad mhmm so of course don't have enough information but it seems like there is this coating of pfc which happens around burgers and pizza boxes and sandwiches etcetera mhmm basically it's heat resistant mhmm it makes the box more durable mhmm it's water and grease resistant mhmm so it's very like valuable for the manufacturers of the food to send it in this packaging but this is actually banned in 2019 oh okay so i'm not sure if people because it's linked to cancer and other problems no i i see you know what really worries me it's not about the fact that something which is harmful which is banned in the past what really makes me worried now is what is it that we are using right now which is going to be banned ten years later right because i i i i don't know man when i am you know like 55 i don't want the government to suddenly come with an associate i mean announcement saying boss you know that thing which you're reading are you going to cancel causing man congrats now we are banning it sorry bro so the safest thing is this right if it existed a thousand years ago yeah just go back to the it did now yeah yeah and it's just a lot more safe yeah yeah yeah that's it now countries are taking steps to eliminate plastic and pfcs from the food supply chain but this entire process has been happening for almost a decade and it's impossible to completely remove it globally the food processing market is worth about 4,000,000,000,000 which showcases its enormous economic importance and in a country like india its significance is even more i understand it's bad and all of that the consumer is consuming it this is a fact yeah right fmcg companies do well that means they have found product market fit no we are a firm people are a firm to make them money agreed agreed crazy 100% including us right including us a 100% now i have a question here the highest amount of i think noodles and packaged food exported in the world did you know india's number one i had no idea i was very shocked people are consuming our instant noodles they're consuming our i actually thought it'd be the america it's not actually it's india india's number one 9% of all people employed in india are employed through the packaged food industry what yeah so you're saying i i take i take like 100 dudes 10 of them work in packaged food yeah no i don't know how this 9% has come does it mean someone working on a farm and that becomes a wafer chip is also employed is it calculated like that i mean part of the food chain semi value chain i mean you can't ban this yeah how will it change i don't know like what's the end game over here right but there's some good news though alternative packaging is coming but it's still kind of far away and though the corporations are taking various measures we still can't eliminate the existence you know a lot of livelihood is dependent upon processed and packaged food industry you know some packaged food claims to be healthier choice yep and people think that they're feeling great about it yeah yeah yeah is total bullshit i know speaking of bullshit yeah have you heard about greenwashing yeah i've heard this one this is basically companies claiming that this is very eco friendly and saves the polar bear etcetera when actually they're doing pretty much gun time right and and and i think a lot of people have told me that evs are actually greenwashing people into buying these cars electric vehicles and greenwashing the only way you can know is watch the next episode on electric vehicles hit that like and subscribe and see you in the next one",

    "transcript_full": "haha okay bye y my mom my dad my mama even my friend's ex-boyfriend is telling me to invest where do I invest okay there's a basic checklist that you have to follow number one is look out for your risks look out for the capture ratio and uh look out for the rolling returns oh and also one more thing very important your portfolio should be Diversified you should invest in all the asset classes are listen to me make sure a portfolio is Diversified hello hello sir not right T I need your help T I'm busy 2 minutes not right now social media crisis huh now that you're listening I had a word with abish I wanted to get better with Investments but everything that he said went above my head obviously I've taught him really well what's your point my point is I don't have the interest to get into the details I need a very simple plan so that I can make more money look I can't go around everyone and tell them how to manage their money I have better things to do so I'm sorry okay go and ask that boy my performance will get better if I make more but last quarter your performance is really bad which is why I need to get it better I'll do it in 10 minutes though done okay done let's get [Music] started so what do you know about the stock market there are companies okay that grow so they list themselves on what uh Stock Exchange Market okay huh then uh you buy them where some app got it so looks like you know a lot what we'll do is we can spend 20 minutes 30 minutes just understanding how all of this works or I'll do a very back of the envelope quick version okay it will not be 100% accurate but it will not be wrong also but you'll get an idea of what this is because I have time and in 10 minutes I have to make your 10-minute plan so we'll do this quickly okay so can you pass me this all right I'll take a small op of this now let's imagine that this is a company and all these blocks are represented by shareholders now these are multiple shareholders you have some promoters you have investors you have all these other things now these companies grow can you name me an international brand any brand Nike Nike Perfect You're a sports girl right that's fine do you think Nike is selling more shoes today than it was selling say 20 years ago definitely so there is some growth what do you think is unique about Nike that no other company has uh they're doing really well okay they're doing well what else do you think they're a good brand yeah maybe so and people trust the name right so whatever they have some modes and people like that this particular company so this is the company let's suppose it's Nike and it has a bunch of shareholders now for whatever reason the shareholders think that the company's value is going to increase let's suppose you also feel that the company's value is going to increase it's going to do more sales it's going to make more profit more people are going to run more people going to use their wear athlean is a thing blah blah blah Nike XYZ company and you also want to buy a certain stake now you can't buy a stake just like that because the company's private for us normal folk to buy a stake in a company it has to list on a public Stock Exchange and it's called a stock exchange because anyone can just go and buy and sell it and invest in a company so now this company has to list on a stock exchange and let's suppose we have this in India we have two stock exchanges National Stock Exchange and Bombay Stock Exchange I'll represent both with one propop and uh let's say you and me and let's say bunch of other people are now allowed to buy and sell this stock so if I give you some money first Co salary you so invest some of it and you get a share for the investment that you made that's it that's what a stock exchange is now over a period of time if the stock does well people will pay more for it how much did you pay for this what's the price of the share say 300 say 300 rupees let's say the stock was doing 100 crores in Revenue 10 years from now it's doing 1,000 crores in Revenue do you think the value of the company's increased yes it has right so basically what you've done is we've added more value to the company so basically if the company does well the stock price goes up and you just sort of earned more money because the value of your share went up this is step one completed H okay now I got this but now which stock should I buy I'll tell you what stock to buy but before that you tell me what the summary of this entire thing was what just happened okay so this was a company and I bought the shares for this company say right now and then 10 years later it grew so obviously the profits also grew so my money has increased correct so this is basically M mot how the stock exchange and all this works so your question was what stock should I pick yes the truth is you'll have to learn a lot of stuff to actually know what stock to pick but just tell me just give me names now I don't want to know the entire process you have to learn it by yourself because this keeps changing you'll have to do the analysis yourself you'll have to spend weekends on it time so this was supposed to be a Simple Plan so let's scrap that let's do a simple version a good way to figure this out is with a mutual fund now what's the difference between a mutual fund and a stock let me explain let me make this a little simpler can we remove this entire block and represent one company with just one block because it'll just make life easier so I'll pick this up now this is one company here H now do you think that other companies also yeah of course so there's another company and another company and another company and another and another company and this brings us to step number two let's understand what a mutual fund is yeah so now all of this has to be selected now there're actually 5,000 companies so imagine 5,000 of these blocks over here they're listed they're listed okay on the stock exchange and you'll have to pick maybe 10 or 15 from them okay sounds like a lot of work so a simple way to do this is to get a mutual fund so to understand a mutual fund I have a pouch here this pouch represents a mutual fund a mutual fund basically has a manager right here as you can see this manager's job is to actually make sure that his mutual fund is actually doing well so he will pick certain stocks so he'll pick certain stocks based on whatever his fund analysis is and he'll manage it and put it inside the mutual fund so now you you don't have to worry about what stocks to pick because the mutual fund manager has done it for you they've done their own research and you basically buy the mutual fund directly one question if this person selected a bunch of stocks today these companies are relevant 5 years later this brand or AI made something better and they don't exist then what good good point so basically that's their job their job is to rebalance the portfolio or say hey this company doesn't seem good anymore so I'll replace it with this one and now now there's a new portfolio and what did you do for this nothing also why do you think this guy is actually managing it he gets money for him correct but where does the money come from profits you oh me okay you so whatever you invested inside the fund m a portion of that goes to the asset management company think of it like a fee but it's expressed in a percentage so they charge a percentage of whatever you in invested every year as a management fee did you get it yes but I still don't know which mutual fund to invest it correct can you name me a few mutual funds types of mutual funds uh yeah yeah yeah so there is midcap small cap and large cap okay and what about these have you seen these before equity tax flexi cap small cap depth R risk shortterm hybrid hybrid I thought that was a working situation okay abage what the hell is arage arbitrage correct confusing right so now how do you pick a mutual fund very simple first we learn how to pick the right fund using a bunch of metrics then we'll have to learn how to analyze the returns and volatility over a period of time we'll have to review the mutual fund some no no no this is not simple how is this simple so if you want to take the simple route let's learn about index funds what is index let's figure it out so now now that we've cleared this let's suppose we had to select 10 companies out of 5,000 companies that I told you how would you select 10 companies abido randomly abido randomly what could be another way if you had to pick the safest of them what would you do uh best performing best performing now what's the metric it should not be the returns of the stock it should actually be the size of the stock or how large that company is okay so what if you pick the top 10 largest companies out of the five ,000 is that sort of like a safer bet in guessing these stocks are these companies are probably okay than the bottom 10 yeah okay so what I'll do is we'll create a list of 1 2 3 4 5 each of these represents the top 10 companies in the country so the first top 10 number one to number 10 then number one to number 20 the number 20 to 30 you get the point the top 50 so these are obviously the largest and the best companies that we have in India this is called an index okay and this top 50 stocks is called nifty 50 and we have a list of 30 stocks which is the same thing but the top 30 and that's called the sensex now of course the index is something called a weighted average but we won't cover that over here now let's suppose the top company went bankrupt for whatever reason what would happen to the index it'll get replaced it'll get replaced so this is very interesting that means if the company is performing well and is relatively larger to everyone else it stays in the list otherwise it's removed if you look at this over here you'll see this is what Nifty looks like this from year 2000 to now look at this it started here at 900 rupees K low and it's at 22,000 almost 23,000 right now do you think the composition of the index of these 50 companies way back in 2000 is the same as 2024 no it would have got replaced right so the companies which didn't go do well are gone the companies which grew were back in what if instead of picking stocks you just picked the index now there are multiple kinds of index but the point is in any of the indices you're not selecting the stock It's Just Happening based on this one logic who's doing this H is it an algorithm uh well it's actually a very simple calculation you can just do it on Excel so mutual funds have index funds so there are two kinds of funds the first kind is the one that we just showed you the one where the manager is selecting stocks making a bucket out of it and saying this is my fund the second kind of fund is where the manager isn't actively picking the stocks he's just following this logic this is a simple way for you to get started investing invest in an index funds but make sure you start with a lowcost Index Fund what is a lowcost index so I I told you that the managers or the company charges something to manage the fund which was where this guy right this girl this girl okay this queen charges something um to manage your fund right and as they should because they're managing the fund now if they're using the logic of this where you don't really have to do stock selection shouldn't the cost be lower yeah so for example a managed fund would be upwards of 1% a year but if you do this version where it's an index fund you can actually be paying something as low as 3% and over a period of time it actually compounds because that much less money is leaving your account and not going to someone as as fees I have a question3 or see okay I have a magical sheet over here okay so imagine if you did a monthly sipo 15,000 rupees and you invested in two funds 15,000 15,000 one in a low expense ratio fund and one in a higher expense ratio fund wait what is expense ratio M nothing it's just the fees you're being charged by the asset management company or the fund house basically that's called the expense ratio or the total expense ratio called teer it basically combines the management fees the administrative fees and the marketing and distribution expenses of the fund okay so let's get back back to the sheet what do you think is the difference in say 20 years and I'm assuming a 12% return because over the last many years Nifty has averaged about 12% that 15,000 sip in 20 years becomes 1.46 crores versus the other fund which is 1.15 crores that's a different of 31 lakhs but again my point is ke remove the percentages okay who's better at this the answer is the answer is the answer is no one knows and I have something very interesting here it's called the it's called the spiva report say it with me this is what it is basically uh what these guys did is they have measured the returns of indices versus managed funds and it turns out 63% of the time active fund managers have not been able to beat passive investing passive investing is investing in an index because no one's managing it it's passive if you want to take the simple way without thinking too much then over a long period of time a lowcost Index Fund is just tension free is probably better I'll opt for that cool so your homework is to pick a bunch of funds and tell me how you picked it cool awesome and your homework is to follow this is not insta subscribe in see you in the next episode if I'm a nice boss it will not feel nothing out of the ordinary real no because in real life I'm nice no rolling and roll so if I give you some money you want to do scrunchy relatability [Music]

    "title_current": "Why INDIA can not BAN Pan Masala",
    "transcript_full": "the Indian government has spent 1,200 crores of taxpayer money to clean good custards and it's not just trains you'll find these stains on roads airports even bus stands not to mention the Hara bridge but here are five reasons why the government can't just ban tobacco even if they want to you know things aren't so simple imagine this a woman Kavita working 12 hours a day on a farm tirelessly for barely 300 rupees and is working to earn for a family of six people now during the day what would she have for lunch maybe Dal chavel or something nutritious but in most cases it's actually no lunch and just a packet of gutka there are 7 CR Indian women who suppress hunger with gutka and this economically makes sense for them because if they eat less and they can spend more time working earning and spending less money on food in fact if you look at this data here this chart you can see that the poor people living in rural areas and those with no schooling actually have a very high chance of consuming gutka more often than not these people work in the unorganized sector where the physical labor is really hard really demanding so if you have a cheap product that relaxes people gives them a little bit High improves their mood and makes them work harder so they can earn for their family is it really bad but the problem with gka is that it's leaving Le stains all over the country and it's a national embarrassment and you see because parents are eating gutka so openly then their children also copy it's easy to hide it's cheap and kids actually consume it so should it be banned probably yes right but it's easy for me to say this for people like Kavita the answer is not so black and white and another reason is culture you know tobacco become a cultural part of India but how does something become part of culture marketing if you think tobacco and gutka ads don't impact anyone think again you're completely wrong now technically you cannot actually advertise these products but companies are smart they found a way to bypass these regulations really cleverly these ads are promoting CDs soda bottled water and even chai and they're not really promoting a sin this is called Sate advertising where they're advertising a less popular product but because of the brand Association they're really advertising something else now gutka companies may do surrogate advertising but cigarette companies can't because of stricter regulations thanks to to ca but then how did it even become part of culture actually I have an interesting story for you craving something sweet and don't want those extra calories don't worry reach for a cigarette cigarette making you cough don't worry get one with a filter tip even your doctor recommends It Anyway back then there were no rules about marketing so they went freaking crazy and they even sold to kids they sold to kids and for men they sold us the idea of being Bly be a malbora man is what they said and they became the biggest cigarette seller ever so if you wonder why Indian teenagers smoke to look cool now you know so looking at your friends the cool kids everyone trying smoking in the peer pressure you also try it once twice one more time and slowly it becomes a habit and then everyone's doing it and it becomes normal and that my friend is how it becomes part of culture and once something becomes part of culture it becomes really difficult to ban you just normalize it it becomes part of life and it's just how you live but there's one other big [Music] problem and that's passive smoking and look at these graphs that we found here you can see that in north and Central India over 60% households people actually smoke and in some Northeastern states it's 90% so basically it means it's culturally normal for elders to smoke in front of people so younger people will be influenced to smoke when they grow up it's like when you're in your office and your colleague takes you outside and your smoker friend smokes and that smoke comes right into your nostrils and why I'm not a smoker the problem of passive smoking is that you get the repercussion that a smoker gets you see at the end of a tip when a smoker is smoking that fume is worse than what the smoker is inhaling because there's no filter to filter it and in fact if you look at this data here one out of 10 tobacco related deaths were due to passive smoking so basically even if you don't consume BD or cigarette you are being affected by it because of the passive inhalation so why aren't we just Banning it well because it makes money for the economy okay this is really interesting some women in villages perform the task of being a BD roller and if they do this they get a BD card the BD card is so prestigious that's almost equal to a government job giving them regular work PF and so many other benefits in fact the women who hold BD cards find it really easy to get a groom and also don't have to pay any dowy think about it the entire tobacco industry employs 4.5 CR people in the entire process collection of the leaves manufacturing the farming in fact just BD rollers in the country are 44 lakh people and you have 22 lakh tribals involved in leaf collection the problem is really simple if you ban tobacco these 4.5 CR jobs are at risk in fact they'll vanish it's equal to like a small country population somewhere 4 and a half CR another reason is farming you see the tobacco crop is drought resistant which means it can grow at places where other crops cannot be harvested profitably so a tobacco farmer can actually grow it in a really short period of time since it's a short duration crop and in 3 months it can Harvest and sell it and there is always a buyer for tobacco so for Farmers it's a great way to actually earn money especially if they don't have fertile land they can grow tobacco and earn some cash India is the second largest producer of tobacco in the world so clearly it's a huge cash crop for the economy but you know if we ban tobacco something interesting would happen and that's illegal sales and loss of Revenue so let's talk about loss of tax revenue now if you look at tobacco it is really highly taxed because it's a Sy tax and rightly so the government earns about 53,000 CR rupees every single year and this was a few years ago 2025 it's probably going to be higher now what the government can do is increase the taxes even more so the consumption reduces logically that makes sense but will consumption actually reduce probably not because there'll be illegal sales if taxes are increased way too much then people will stop buying the Branded cigarettes that are being sold right now which means the unorganized markets will actually open up and they'll sell cigarettes illegally at cheaper options now this is not only bad for our government because it reduces their revenue it's also bad for the consumer because maybe these illegal unregulated products are just worse for your health in fact something like this has happened in the past in the 1920s in America but the product was not tobacco it was alcohol and it was called the prohibition the prohibition stated that you cannot consume alcohol and it cannot be sold which reduced Road rages which red used fights but it also had another effect the crime bosses got up controlled the alcohol trade and sold it illegally and made tons of cash which means the government didn't make money the gangsters made cash and it was bad for health for the consumers too holy it's interesting that any question never has a yes or a no there's always like a gray to be decoded but I don't think you can ban tobacco if people want to smoke they will smoke but the solution is probably in Media this entire mess started with media where it showed that smoking was cool maybe if we change that and the imagery of tobacco becomes uncool the Next Generation 30 years from now won't smoke anymore",

    "title_current": "Why Indians can’t Quit UPSC",
    "transcript_full": "over 10 lakh people take the upsc exam every year and only nine 100 actually get in that's about 0.08% yet india is completely obsessed with upsc why we have good salary order shittas or stability yeah to acquire power but what's now neeraj is 22 and he just graduated from patna as a ba student his father works as a driver and earns 20,000 rupees per month to support his family but the problem is that forty two percent of all undergraduates in india do not have the required skills to get a job while people could become doctors engineers lawyers or all of these other professions the problem is very simple either they don't have good colleges which can train them to become those professionals or two they just don't have the money required to pay the fees to actually get there most indians select a degree like ba and that's why for this skill set a government job actually makes sense it's about moving your family out of poverty into a more comfortable life it's about believing in the fact that you can really work hard and despite not knowing english you can still lead a great life and this is exactly why neeraj moves to old rajendra nagar in delhi to become an ias officer but after one year of of preparation he fails remember life is a race now neeraj still has a few attempts left so it's completely fine and how he reaches his goal is the true lesson of this episode and i'll obviously tell you that in the end but clearing the upsc exam is not easy in 2022 about 11.5 lakh people attempted this exam about 13,000 people cleared the prelims and about 2,500 actually cleared the mains and in the end you had about 900 people which were appointed as officers in the government so the passing rate is zero point zero eight percent i wanted to look at this number it's a really small percentage because if you looked at say iits it's point 5% really hard also but harvard and stanford are more than 3% this makes upsc one of the hardest exams to crack in the world if you think that was bad take a look at the upsc syllabus if you have prepped for this please tell us your experience in the comments because this does not end so you're basically expected to know everything which means aspirants are spending fifteen hours a day just reading so the morning starts with the hindu then you go for coaching classes and evening is spent in the library and then you have no time for anything else because your life revolves around clearing that paper now let's talk about money not earning but expenses so people move from small cities to larger cities like delhi to actually get coached coaching costs between 50,000 and 2 lakh rupees but that's not it you have 8,000 to 15,000 rupees spent per month in just living expenses and a lot of people's backgrounds don't allow for these kinds of expenses so they have to have a part time job the story of manoj kumar from twelfth fail is actually a reality for many aspects but in neeraj's case his family could actually afford to send him to delhi but for all the other fees and expenses his dad had to use his life savings to actually fund it and this is the truth for tens of thousands of people maybe lakhs of people who are selling their family homes their ancestral land even selling their jewelry and using their entire life savings just to make sure their child can go and has an attempt to become an officer then comes a very interesting problem that you only see after you're inside the upsc chakrabhu imagine studying for an ocean like syllabus which you can never really complete properly then you have 10 lakh people competing for just 900 seats and the probability is less than 0.1% it'll wreak havoc on your self confidence and what you think about your future i mean imagine this you graduate from a college at 22 then move on to an entirely these exams have consumed four years of neeruji's life now at this point he spent way too much time and one more attempt maybe he can get through or does he pick up the guts to actually try a completely different path because he's wasting the best years of his life well at this point all aspirants use a special tool and that's called hope neeraj has hope which means he keeps going he wants to take the exams again and again because success seems really really close and the question is why doesn't he just switch to a different exam or a different opportunity and change the course of his life there are three things at play over here one the exam trap the way that the exam trap is designed is that as soon as you finish one exam you have to prepare for the next because it's right around the corner this chakra view never stops ending and you have no time to actually sit and reflect also preparing for a different kind of exam has a different syllabus a different mindset a different way to attempt those questions so you just don't do it because upsc requires focus the second is sunk cost fallacy you spend two to four years prepping for this doing a good job and being completely immersed and disciplined so you think this fallacy is exactly like when you go and watch a really boring movie and halfway through you can go and leave but you don't because you've sat through halfway let's finish the rest even though you're not really enjoying it at least the popcorn's good the third point it's civil services i mean think about the perks that a government servant gets he has a decent salary he gets a chauffeur driven car a house and so many perks i can't even list it in this video and people think all i have to do is pass this exam and i'll get everything my life will be sorted so one more attempt is probably worth it and we have tons of examples of doctors engineers and even lawyers leaving those jobs and attempting upsc to become officers officers because of the power and prestige it offers and then we have another villain in this story and that are toxic success stories i'm sure you've seen headlines like this who doesn't love a rags to riches story it's like you're watching an actual movie look where he is today all through this you have social media hyping this up you have movies hyping this up you even have relatives and sometimes parents hyping this up not to mention those coaching centers which are saying once you get in look what will happen but when was the last time you heard about an actual officer talking about his real problem in the workplace i mean read these headlines these jobs are not easy but coaching institutes won't talk about this because it's a 58,000 crore industry which is growing and their job is admissions and not talking about how tough this job is so people fall for all of these motivations and in the end attempt upsc again it's neeraj's last attempt he can't fail again all the money his parents spent over the last six years the money that could have been used to get better food visit the doctor when his mother got sick all that money will suddenly become purposeless they say knowledge will never go to waste but what will you do with that knowledge if it doesn't convert to some kind of income most companies care about practical skills and experience and execution not history civics and gk and just like neeraj we have aspirants who finish all their attempts they're now 28 to 32 years old and they've been dependent on their parents for the longest time while their friends have been working for years now these aspirants haven't reached anywhere in their lives but thankfully in 2025 upsc has included a new rule where they'll publicly show your name and all of your information if you pass the exam but didn't clear the interview this means you will get some preference for all the work that you did so the question over here is this is all this effort worth it well the answer is yes and no for people who don't have a lot of options who are looking for gray and blue collar work this actually would make sense because the prestige the money everything seems worth it but for people who actually have other options in their lives like private companies etcetera perhaps you shouldn't be spending six years on something like this having said that even after all these problems all these issues all those low probabilities it all seems hello papa arbiter may i ask",

    "transcript_full": "I have you've not replied to my email what what the hell is happening uh [Music] second second I'm selling it I'm selling it almost done almost done what the hell what are you doing are sir let me I'm doing something really important wait sir the markets are down I have to sell my mutual funds sell your mutual funds this is not how this works how this works this is the problem you spend all this time selecting a mutual fund carefully doing your discipline investing and then one thing happens and you start selling that's not how you should think about it today we'll do an activity and through this activity we'll understand why do people sell and because of that you'll understand that sometimes selling is even more important than buying so let's understand how selling or exiting a mutual fund works [Music] here we have a group of 13 investors who started their sips in the nifty50 index starting January 2015 they come from different backgrounds and age group and they started investing for different reasons let the games begin December 2015 Nifty fell by 4.06% so if you're invested 1,000 rupes it would have become $ 950 even a small drop like this can cause panic and you can see one investor right there he saw his returns in red and sold his funds July 2016 two investors who are friends decided to get married marriage is an important event in anyone's life so let's not forget it requires some money and thanks to those ever so modest fat weddings we need the cash the couple redeemed their marriage funds to cover their wedding expenses and they're out November 2016 something thrilling happened on on November 8th 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee currency notes will no longer be legal tender we all scrambled to check our wallets to figure out how many notes need to be exchanged and amidst all this chaos some people faced a cash crunch in their businesses also the market was taking a nap a few investors thought redeeming their mutual funds was the perfect solution these guys out of the race January 2018 two of our investors reached retirement age the time to finally relax and enjoy the fruits of your labor congratulations now they want to shift their Equity Funds to debt funds to keep their Investments safer and these guys are out they also exit March 2020 then comes the fear an announcement was made [Music] lockdown on March 23rd to protect ourselves masks became our new normal and sanitizers were everywhere what happened to the markets they took a really hard hit falling about 133% in a single day an investor from our group tested positive for covid and he needed money for treatment so he sold his mutual funds it was also a time for financial distress some people lost their jobs and had no income they had to sell their Investments these guys are out too December 2023 one of our investors achieved Financial Freedom wow he saved and invested for this day and the day finally come celebrate July 2024 finally two of our investors held on to their Investments for for 9 and A2 years they invested 1 lakh which grew to about 2.95 lakh that's almost three times of what they invested this shows why staying invested for a long time is often said to be the most powerful thing in investing so I hope you get the point and this was useful yes butab no while you guys were doing that activity no I have noted down a couple of important points okay very important check this out so over here you return green flag achievement of goal that means you can sell it okay portfolio has to be rebalanced that you're selling good not bad red flag here I'm sure it's wrong selling out of panic yeah correct to get quick cash you don't want to get quick that's a red flag no you don't sell mutual funds I say so proud of you you missed too so if you look at the green flag we talked about this last time funds under performance we talked about this in the last conversation so you should watch that video so let me add this funds under performance and the red flag ignoring costs this is something that we covered in this episode remember we talked about it the guardal episode yes the guardal episode so make sure to take that into account as well but this looks good sir okay I have one question okay I have four uh mutual funds four sips basically with different objective so one is for my marriage one is for my kids education marriage uh home loan and my retirement fund not bad now imagine a situation you remember the market fell down 13% on one single day so what if something like this happens I I I'll continue investing no if something like that happens I'll continue investing let's paint a picture okay okay I know what you're saying let's paint a picture let's suppose something happens and the market Falls 10% and another 10% and another 20% it falls total 50% so all the money you created over the last few years it'll become half half what half it will fall by 50% 50 what I mean it'll fall no Shi okay so what you're saying is you invested for so long and then 50% Market fell what's the point of compounding is you have to zoom out compounding happens over a long period of time will the market Fall 20 30 40% in the future yes then no one knows let me give you a easy way to do this are all of you a little panicked a little scared just like him and I can guarantee the market will fall in the future and I'm not talking about India every Market because markets fall it's in their nature we have to be prepared and patient and I'll give you a simple way um okay perfect so imagine this is your marriage fund okay and this is let's suppose 20 lakh rupees now you're going to get married tomorrow no sir you'll know in advance right one year now what you can do is instead of withdrawing the entire amount in one shot and saying sh you withdraw it in parts or withdraw it systematically so this systematic withdrawal is what you can do and is the opposite of a systematic investment plan which is the Sip which is what you're doing right now now ask me why why okay we don't know whether the market will go up or down or sideways correct correct but we don't know over a long period of time the market will go up correct correct so if the market is going up we don't know how much it will go up if the market is going down we know how much it will go down so a good buffer is you just spread your investment over a long period of time for example if the market is falling and you invest every single month you've also invested at the top you've also invested at the bottom and your average entry is in the center the average right so that's a pretty good entry price then the market reverses again you're averaging your entry so your average entry is here as the market is going up and down so you don't have to worry about timing the market correct okay now the same thing could be true for your withdrawal let's suppose the market crashes and then you withdraw your your entire amount this is not 20 lakhs anymore it's only 10 that's a problem right correct M so instead of timing the market to exit what you should do is one year in advance start withdrawing equal to 12 months aramam say that way you will average the exit but sir I'll spend that so imagine if I'm getting married 12 months from now I start the uh the S swp plan from now this month itself right I will be spending that money maybe after 10 months or maybe after 9 months now if I'm withdrawing this fund I'll well I know myself I'll spend it somewhere else so I'm losing my marriage fund no so I think there one thing if it's one year in advance you can plan your expenses so you can plan a marriage cards here 9 months before I'll do the hall booking 8 months before I'll book tickets in hotel etc etc and you can spread your expenses but the advantage is not about spending the advantage is let's suppose the market Falls like this and you exit here because you're getting married and then the market goes up you will feel so much of regret no I with draw next month Market went up and the Bull Run happened but we can't predict this so a good way is as the market is falling you're withdrawing every single month because you're going to achieve your goal your average exit will be average it will not be on either end same thing if the Market's moving up you will not get the topmost price you'll get somewhere in the middle because you're with drawing every month so this helps you mentally and also mathematically to average out your exit if you're averaging in with an sip why can't you average out with a s swp or the systematic withdrawal plan doesn't that make sense well that's right sir can I apply this this Funda on my other goals as well like for my kids education or my home loan is that possible of course it is any goal which you have a long time you're invested in and then you start withd drawing it and it's planned it reduces stress in your life so it's the same thing Corpus B Corpus moving something over a period of time to achieve your goal this is fine the only problem is you can't do this on a one-ear time frame or a 2-year time frame it should ideally be as long as possible but let me show you a super uh short time frame of 3 years so actually I made this for myself but um I'll show this to you basically there's an initial investment and then there's a 25,000 rupe per month sip okay and this goes on for 3 years now you can just copy paste this and turn this into 7 years or 10 years whatever you like I've made 3 years because just easier okay and by the third year it's reached 1767 lakhs this for which goal any goal so I I don't know what the goal is you can decide what your goal is okay the car okay the car now this assumes index returns it assumes the market is normal and nothing like a 2008 thing has happened yeah now at this point you know that okay one year from now my marriage is happening or I have to buy my car or something whatever your goal is you get 17.67% you get a number you start withdrawing that every month towards your goal so right here you can see that this ends right here after 12 months and you can use this calculator to basically calculate any amount for any time period for yourself but to do this and to get this calculator you'll have to do a 01 Mission a 01 mission is a simple way for the community you guys to get in and take control of your finances go to the link in the description click on it complete it and while you play this game that we call a mission you'll be able to figure this part of your life out so you'll have another question which is how do you do an S swp what website do you go to yes yes yes yes I dop please tell me sir I tell everyone how do you do an sip mutual fund and it either Auto debits every month or you invest every month correct correct all mutual funds also offer an S swp all you need to do is get in touch with the person you're speaking to if it's an adviser if it's an app figure it out on your app and it's just a different mode and you can start doing it so sir big question what's the checklist what's the checklist one don't exit when the market Falls a lot you're not supposed to Second maybe we could say if you want to exit do it in a planned way have a corpus have a Target then do an s swp it's a smarter way and also when you do this exercise you understand what can you actually afford and it actually hurts your egoo but it tells you and saves you from bankruptcy in the future do you really want to be a 40-year-old who doesn't have any money do you really no right so it's fine it helps you understand yourself and where you are right now sir I want to be millionaire in my 40s maybe you could if you watched all these episodes so hit that like And

    "title_current": "Is Silver the BEST Investment of 2025?",
    "transcript_full": "Check this out. Gold has given some 43% and silver has given 48%. If you compare this to Nifty, it's just 6.5%. So in this episode, we're going to answer three questions. One, could the market go up like another 100% from here? Once we answer that, we need to know which one to buy, gold, silver, or both? And how much? So that's the second question, how much? And the third question is, how the hell do you actually buy it? Do you buy physical gold and silver or do you go digitally and just buy it online? And most importantly, I will give you THC framework. This framework will tell you how much of gold or silver to buy and how much money you can actually make. The year was 1991. [Music] We were in deep trouble. Our forex reserves were so low we barely had enough to cover 2 weeks of imports. And when Indians don't have money, the only thing they have is gold. We pledged tons and tons of gold, physical bars of gold to the Bank of England and the Union Bank of Switzerland. This was actually flown in and this footage is actually real. That got us out. And in fact, if you look at the economy, we have not looked back. The economy has actually done well. So gold really helped us. It's also true for you and me. When we run out of cash, our mothers have gold stashed away somewhere that even she has forgotten. So this is true for all banks in the world as well. This is how central banks across the world are buying gold. Do you see 2020 that if you remember is when we had the corona crisis and we have a little dip there but after that it's gone up a lot and this is driving demand. As soon as that happens, other investors follow suit and they buy gold as well. Central banks buy gold for many reasons. One reason is for example, it's a store of value. Another reason is they want to move away from US. And then there is the biggest reason of all Trump. But this doesn't answer the question of silver. If all central banks are buying gold, then why are silver prices going up? Silver is used in multiple heavy machinery industries and most importantly EVs, semiconductor chips and all these other things some of which I don't even know. People are buying silver because they need to actually use it in realworld application and that's where the buying is coming from. So it's important for you to note that most of the demand for gold comes emotionally for silver. It's always been application. It comes from industries. Now, there's a lot of hype around EVs. If the EV's demand goes up, you know whose demand goes up as well? Silver. Because silver is used 2x more in an EV vehicle than in normal ICE vehicles. So, this means if gold and silver both are going up, we know the reasons for it. We should buy both, right? Look at this chart over here. This is what gold looks like and this is what silver looks like. So, we went to the World Gold Council's website and it has a really cool calculator. Here it gives you the correlation or the connection between gold, silver and nifty. You see it's 0.749 in green between gold and silver. Meaning a strong positive correlation and buying both metals together isn't really a good idea if you're looking to diversify. And in the case of Nifty and silver, it's 0.28 in red, meaning the price movement happens in the opposite direction. Nifty and gold is almost 0%. Essentially, it means there is no correlation. Now, correlation and all is great, but it doesn't really answer our core question. Should you buy gold or silver? But to answer that, you have to understand the currency effect. Take a look at this. So, one thing you should know that all gold and silver that we get in our country is imported. The World Gold Council says about 82% or 86% is imported and silver is about 92%. Imported. Now when we say imported, we pay in dollars. And here's what it looks like. So let's suppose we as a country are purchasing gold. And let's make the numbers a little easy. 1 USD and let's see what happens. So it's the year 2007. And 1 USD is equal to roughly 40 INR. I want you to remember this 2007 one USD is worth INR and we are paying rupees for the dollar to buy the gold. Now over the next few years, if you go through the next few years, I'll make a line up over here. In 200, and this is the same gold, 2022, 1 USD was worth about 80R. Notice, assume that gold has not changed in price. It's the same price because we bought it in dollar denominated terms. that one USD has actually appreciated. INR has depreciated and this 40 has become 80. So our investment has doubled just because of this currency effect. Now what this means is gold but currency effect. What I mean is that gold is going up but along with it to sweeten the deal the currency is also depreciating in our favor. So that effect is also happening and I have actual numbers here. Gold in the last 30 years has given a 7.6% return in USD. But if I include this effect then the return is not 7.6 it's 11%. Same thing for silver last 30 years dollar return is 6.4%. But if you include the currency it's 9.8% return. Now this USD INR thing is great but it doesn't answer how much silver and gold to buy and whether the prices will double from here or the market will fall that I will explain very clearly in the THC framework but just before that you should know how to buy it right should you buy physical should you buy digital which is the best way to do let's quickly look at this chart first you have gold and silver ETFs you buy and sell them on the stock market just like shares They're super liquid, but remember, you'll pay brokerage fees and a small annual expense ratio. Then we have digital gold on fintech apps. It's convenient to buy tiny amounts, but you pay 3% GST upfront, meaning your investment is down the second you buy it. On top of that, you'll eventually pay storage and delivery. This is also fine, but you should just know these costs. Then there's the mutual fund route. It's a fund that invests in ETFs. But the catch is you pay double the fees. You pay for the fund and also the ETF that it holds and you only get the end of day price. The advantage here is if you feel that a manager can actually manage a fund better, then maybe that route makes sense for you. And finally, we have physical gold and silver. It's tangible, but it's the priciest option by far. You lose money immediately on GST. Then there could be massive making charges. Then there's a locker fee, right? That's the cost cuz you have to store this thing somewhere. So depending on what you value, there's an option for everyone. On the other side, when you compare it to silver ETFs, it's a lot better because one, the liquidity is super simple. You can buy and sell it very quickly and all these charges do not exist. You are only paying these charges. So there are some charges, but it is relatively lesser. But the downside of an ETF is that the physical feeling emotional of going to mama papa and saying coin that does not exist. So if you're buying it for an emotional connection, maybe the ETF doesn't make sense. Now comes the most important part, the THC framework. As soon as something hits a high, the person over here says, \"Ooh, look at this.\" This includes labubus as well. Look at this. This is true for anything from houses to gold to silver. Which is why we made this video. The entire point of this video is so that we can teach you the THC cycle. The hype cycle. The hype cycle is everyone's talking about something because it's cool right now. Who was talking about gold 4 years ago? No one. Because it wasn't cool enough. But the fact is this doesn't make Nifty bad or gold good or silver bad. It makes our understanding of assets wrong. Everything follows a cycle. So why should you worry about whether you should buy in gold or silver? The answer is you should probably choose one of these assets. Do not invest both in large quantities. Keep it small around 5 10% of your portfolio or direct 5 10% of your monthly SIP into ETFs of each. But probably as a beginner that's a good place to start. Not more than that initially. And do not expect returns in the short term. Think of this as really long. All this narrative in the press saying you 48% return this is all nonsense. You are right here in the hype cycle and this hype cycle is messing with your brain. Do not listen to the hype in the media.",

    "transcript_full": "Abhishek, what are you doing? We're getting late. Come. Sir, one minute. Let's go. Let's go. Sir, I'm doing a couple of payments. Just a second! Yes, ready? What are you doing? Just doing my SIP payments SIP? It's not payments, it's investment. What kind of fund is it? It's mutual fund. Is it direct or regular? Dude, is it direct or regular? You don't know what that is. Dude, if you are a do-it-yourself investor and you pick the wrong kind of fund, you lose lakhs of rupees. Lakhs! Here too? Of course. So before we get to office. What is the right way? Before we get to office, I'll explain both of the kinds and then you decide which one is best for you. So let's begin. Sir, okay, tell me, what's the basic difference between a direct fund and a regular fund? Different stocks or order is placed somewhere else or giving more returns? How does this work?. No, everything is the same. No, everything is the same. So you understand how mutual fund works, right? Very quickly. We have a manager who is managing a pool of money from people like you who are investing. And there is a strategy. Got it. Fine. They are investing, yeah, the fund. Now there are two ways to actually run this. One way is where you go through a financial intermediary this could be a bank, it could be an advisor. Basically an entity who is helping you invest, like an advisor who is telling you what mutual fund is right. So that is called a regular fund. And there because the advisor is actually helping you pick the right funds, he takes a commission. Every fund has a regular mode and a direct mode. Okay. Inside the fund itself? Okay. Same fund. But if you are going through an advisor who is helping you rightfully, then you go through a regular fund and a portion of that is actually something that the advisor keeps. And that's actually a good thing. But if you know what you're doing, you want to do it yourself, and you're a do-it-yourself investor like you. You look at everything, right? What’s happening here? What’s happening there? That’s what you have taught me, sir. I have to watch. In that case, you should pick the direct fund, which means your money goes directly to the AMC, to the asset management company, without an intermediary in between and the expense ratio reduces. What is this expense ratio? What does it mean it reduces? Fees? Yeah, expense ratio is basically the fees that the AMC charges you for managing the money. Yes okay, I know that. And this is expressed in percentage. So if there is a 1% expense ratio on say, one lakh rupees that you have invested, then 1% of one lakh is, Rs.1000 goes to, as a fees. Okay. Okay. It could be 0.5%, could be 0.2%, could be whatever, but as an example. So the first thing you should do check, how much the fund is charging? Oh, yes, yes. What's the expense ratio? Where to check? This is the website. Wait! Here. Here. Check this out. Okay, I got it. This is it. Sir, don't you think this looks a little high? No no, you drive. No, I mean, high is relative, they're doing the work for it. But generally, over the last few decades, has the expense ratio increased? Good question. Yeah, I think it has. I think it's increased because the competition has gone up. The expenses of running a fund have gone up. There is, I think, mostly a lot of competition that has to go, and running a fund is not that easy. Right? I mean, there are a lot of expenses. No. There's their office, there's the fund managers, there's the people working back office. There's marketing. There's all these things that it takes to run a fund. So overall, the cost of the fund is going up. So the expense ratio has gone up a little bit. Yeah. But I think what you should understand is the difference between a direct and a regular fund. For example, this is what you're looking over here. This is the regular fund’s expense ratio. Expense ratio, yes. And if you scroll down here, you'll see that this is the same fund’s direct expense ratio. There's a difference. Right? Right. This is slightly lower. So let's suppose that difference is, let's say, 0.4% example 0.4%. Now, take that 0.4% and compound it over the next 20 years. Assuming you're a do-it-yourself investor, you'll save a lot of money. Right. Because you went direct, but generally, 0.5% 0.6%, I don't think that makes a difference. Compounding is happening on the return side also, and the money that I'm investing, I'm getting returns. 1% is very small amount. That's a good point. That's a good point as usual, you are not correct, Abhishek. I'll tell you what. Let me just make a quick pit-stop and let me show you something interesting. Okay? Here. So you said a little bit like 0.5% or whatever doesn't make a big difference, right? Right. That's what you said, right? Correct. Okay, let me show you something interesting, because I'm getting. No, no, no. Let me show you. Today is going to be an interesting lesson in exponents. In what? Exponents. Never mind. Come here! Imagine you have a single sheet of paper. Yeah. Now I want you to double it. Two sheets of paper. Now, let us suppose you double these two sheets, again. How many sheets do you have? Four. Correct. Now imagine you double these four pieces of paper again. And you have. Eight. And that's two is to the power three. Okay. Why? Now imagine why I'm telling you all of this. Yes, correct. I want you to imagine what is two is to the power 100. How many sheets of paper, how tall, how high. And I don't think you will know the answer to this. I know, I know, I know. What is it? This much? Think big. Two is to the power hundred this big! let's start from scratch. We’ll start from two is to the power ten sheets of paper. We are looking at 10 cm. Okay. 10 cm. Now let us make this, two is to ten to two is to fifteen. 15 cm. Not at all. It will actually be. You see that car? Double of that car. So you should go and just take rest. Two is to ten is ten centimeters, fifteen is double of this car. You know why? Because it's, the number is doubling every time, and you can't humanly imagine how much is it growing. Let's keep going. Two is to twenty, just adding five more becomes the length of that football field, you pretend to play striker on the weekends and fail miserably at it. Two is to the power twenty. Football field? Correct! And two is to the power thirty, how much do you think the football field now becomes? Two to the power thirty From Jammu to Kanyakumari? Actually it's from here all the way to outer space. Right at the edge of space. And two to the power 40 is… moon? That's right. Actually not bad. That's the moon. Now tell me what is two is to the power one hundred? Sun? You should pause the video and try to guess in the comments. It's the sun? Think bigger. Sir, what bigger? It's actually not in… Pluto? Not in kilometers. It's not in planets. It’s not. It's not in universes. It's actually in light years. What? 13 billion light years. Two is to the power hundred 13 billion light years. My point is very simple exponential growth cannot be imagined by a humans because our brains just don't function that way. It's too big of a number to imagine. And you can do that with compounding. In investing, the major growth comes at the end. So your expense ratio is actually also going to compound or have an exponential effect. And that will eat up your profit. Oh, okay. I was talking about from Noida to Gurgaon? Yes. I was saying from Jammu to Kanyakumari? Yes. I am still not okay! In compounding interest the power actually goes to time. So the longer you are, you actually have exponential crazy earnings. Okay, sir. Did you understand something? Okay, sir. I got it. So wait. Basically compounding works both ways, on returns, and on fees, too. Right? Absolutely right. Okay fine. Fair. Okay, sir, I just have one more question. Basically, you know. Of course you have another question. So basically I have a couple of regular funds. Now if I switch from regular to direct, okay, there will be difference in taxes too, right, because I will be exiting from a fund and probably moving that money to a direct fund. So. Okay, interesting. So you are saying if you exit your current funds because there is a large corpus, you will pay tax on it. And then you will move to direct fund, then what will I have left because you lose so much in taxation. That is actually a good point. So the answer, is I don't know. The best way to know is to actually calculate it and figure out whether it is or not. Okay. But I was actually talking about this with a relative a few months ago. And I have an interesting calculation for this. But of course, it's based on his fund. You will show it right away. No, no, I'll just send it to you. Oh okay, I'll open it. Okay. Check it out. That's an Airdrop. Can you see it? Got it. So basically if you invested and you switched and you paid taxes and you did this for a long time again, it makes a difference. You still make savings despite the change. So compounding is the 8th wonder of the world, even in expenses. Sir, this is nice. So basically you have saved thousands and lakhs of money, sir. Lakhs of money. Yeah, lots of money. Correct? That's right. So now I don't need to do the appraisal. Right. No, no, no! But I think there are a few more things you should know when you're switching. You also have exit load. When you are taking out. When you are redeeming the funds and you get to pay something within a time limit. Yeah, you don't get to. You have to pay something when you exit a fund. Not in all funds though. Certain funds have a time limit, so if you do it before one month, before six months, you get to. There's an exit load. You should know if there's an exit load for your investment and include that in your calculation. This is plus expense ratio? Yes! It's actually a good thing, it's to prevent you from exiting too early. Another thing is if you've done an investment like say the ELSS. An ELSS. The tax saving fund? So in an ELSS fund, you can't actually take your money out before three years. And you've already taken a tax rebate on it. So yeah, you can't. A better advice than don't do it is find out what that exit load is. Find out what that tax rate is, put in the calculations, most likely over a long period of time the compounding will still work in your favor. Oh, okay. So you could still exit. But you should know that. I will check my funds, as well. So I will just redeem, okay. Sir, there’s so many fees, exit load, lock-in. What will remain? Dude. One simple way of actually doing it is just doing like an index fund and there the expense ratio. Sir, Index funds are also mutual funds. They will also have expense ratio. Yes. There will also be a condition I get to redeem and I'll have to pay exit load. We're gonna get to office and I can't tell you everything in one car, right? Maybe you can comment if you want us to do something on index funds. And then if we get enough votes, then we'll figure something out. We'll do it. We'll do it. I have a question for you. Why hasn't your performance been that good this quarter? How do you know? I know everything. How come? I am your boss. I have another question for you. Who's written all these questions in this episode? She's been hiding in the back, prompting us the question so we could do a good episode on this. He's the audio guy. You see what great lengths we are going through to actually explain to you how all of this works. And yeah, just see you in the next episode, guys. We are having fun. Bye bye.",

bikes or clothes or spend on food start as early as possible start your investment journey and you would be having 60 rupees by the age of 60 this is rishab he's traveling in this crowded Raa because he wants to save money you will have one rupes by investing [Music] only why is it not going [Music] up okay something was definitely wrong with all those influencers and the people who believe every single word those guys say because you got to live your life a little right I mean life comes once youth comes once and you should live a little so in this episode we're going to talk about those small things where you get a little too over influenced to make your first one CR and forget about living we'll talk about the good and the bad cuz certainly the internet is confusing you let's begin now there's nothing wrong with an influencer promoting financial literacy I mean Z1 also does the same thing we exist because money conversations aren't happening when we were in school college and now that we're adults and frankly India needs to understand how money works but the problem is when the influencers misinform or you get a little over influenced by what they're saying sometimes they only have 1 minute to talk about a story and because it's only 1 minute it's Half Baked information so we have a few examples of what these influencers talk about and how you sometimes get a little over influenced I promise you'll find this really entertaining let's start with point one so Warren Buffett started investing at the age of 11 and this is the reason that he could reap the benefits of compounding at the age of 60 so if you are 20 and if you have not started investing you are already late start investing today guys this is foro inducing nonsense you are not late if you're watching this video and even if you start tomorrow it's completely fine because this story is blown a little out of proportion people say that if you're 22 or 25 and haven't begun your life in the future won't be good enough so you must start immediately because you're already late and the scary thing is these formo inducing words online we searched and this is what we got this is a real excerpt from Kora where someone says oh sorry Reddit where someone says what can I do better I'm a 18-year-old male I take 1,000 per month from my mother to invest and Save in every way I'm waiting for correction as I want to add 1,500 lumsum no sips my mother says I should stop wasting my time and focus on your career your mother is right bro focus on your career right now do the sequence which is get your emergency fund done get your basic savings get your health and life insurance when there's some money left you can start but dude focus on your own skill and growth and not on money I get a lot of DMS from kids who are 20 years old 18 years old and are spending hours and hours trying to find the best penny stock we did a video on that by the way to invest 500 rupees and wasting a lot of time instead of that you could have used your time to upskill let me give you an example we have two friends in all examples we always have two friends so the first friend says dude all these reals on instagramers right I am too late I'm 20 years old and I'll invest 5,000 rupees starting now because comp founding and over a period of 30 years by the time he's 50 he gets about 1.76 crores not bad the other friend says dude I can't invest 5,000 rupees a month one because income and two even if it is I want to enjoy my life a little bit I'm going to spend 3 to four hours every single day and more hours over the weekend upscaling and becoming really good at my work he does not invest for the next 5 years but at age 25 because his work is is good his salary is decent he starts investing 15,000 rupees again over a period of a few years by the time he's 50 he ends up with more money than this guy he ends up with 2.76 cror my point is simple compounding is true but if you're are under 25 you should live life a little bit so your skill is far more important than money here's another lie the influencer told you you will have 1 rupes at 60 by investing just 500 rupes per month in the stock market and increase it by just 10% every year start now these reals are actually really popular because it's a small amount of money over here and a large amount of money over there and it feels magical now my guess is the influencers do this to illustrate the power of compounding and I think they are totally right what a great example the problem happens when the viewer thinks that this is real and this is the best way now there are two problems over here the first first problem is this the 1 number if you think about it over a few decades that one will be worth less than what it's today because of because of you know impation B say so what I'll do is I'll also add inflation and adjust this 1 CR to 2024 and once I adjust it tell me guys in the background how much is it worth 50 LH nope any other guest 25 LH so this 1 CR number after 36 years is worth roughly 17 lakh rupees when you adjust it for inflation so you can't retire on it so then why are you doing it coming to the second point of this story so we've established 500 Rupees is not enough what's a good number 5,000 6,000 what do you guys think take 10,000 but I'm adding 10% every year so we increase it by 10% every year this 10,000 per month contribution actually becomes 1 lakh rupees per month contribution after 25 years now my first question is how much am I actually earning in salary to be able to afford this 1 lakh rupees per month investment so what I did was I assume the salary is 20,000 I know no one invests 10,000 out of 20 but let's assume the salary is 20,000 because it's a common number and let's assume that over a period of time average you're growing at 8% increment a year this 20,000 salary becomes 1.3 lakh rupees per month in 25 years that's not a lot because 1.3 lakh rupees me say 1 lakh you have to spend sorry invest in the market so what's the problem here you might get married you might have kids you might have to stay back to take care of the kids and that is life it's really unpredictable you may not be able to do it on the flip side you may have great events also there may be bonus there may be ESO buyback there may be something that happens that gives you that extra cash and then you can well use that money your mindset should be you may not be able to do a 10% every year but where you can you should invest it so if you get a bonus try not to spend all of it take some of it and invest it and like that over a period of time it may average as a 10% increase so this imaginary number you have of 50 crores in X number of years or 100 cores in X number of years may not happen because life gets in the way but isn't the purpose of accumulating wealth life itself don't be like me when I was young all I did was looked at the future into my Excel sheet and think when I turn X age I will start enjoying life but life just went by your job is to find the Beautiful Moments every single day and if a bonus comes along celebrate it a little more Point number three let me tell you a secret compounding by power of compounding that's actually crazy 7.8 crores from 2001 to now that's actually a lot but here's the problem you won't have the memories of yourself on that bike enjoying going through the valley with your friends and enjoying that beautiful air because youngness will not come back and wrinkles are real and so is white hair can you please enjoy your life and also Jennifer Lopez I would have a house today and a mansion in LA guys there is no way for us to go back in time and do stuff that did really well did any of you think Nvidia would go up so much because then AI race would happen no one can predict the future so when the influencers talk about a stock going up so much in infosis going up so much all they're really trying to do is tell you the power of compounding and the power of investing over a long period bus so the problem about this kind of story is that it's for more inducing you think I don't even need 78 crores so how can I get closer and when you go through all of this you think what is an example of something like this happening today and you might think Ola electric Ola electric might be like aisher and I might make 78 crores in the future this is wrong you analyze Ola electric independently it's management fundamental analysis future industry etc etc then you take risk of investing in it as a investor but you cannot compare these two just because Aisha did it doesn't mean any other company will do it and this is true across the industry across the world on anything that you do these are two different situations and finally people talk about creating a portfolio which gives you dividends and you'll be able to make x amount of money per month and I'm going to tell you how you can make 50,000 Rupees every single month just just by creating a dividend portfolio so watch this video to learn how you can earn 50,000 Rupees in passive dividend income if you write in the comments an interesting influencer thing that you saw that is hilarious the three top comments that get the most engagement the most likes and is actually genuinely good we feature you on the 01 community on the Instagram account put it up see you in the next episode",

    "transcript_full": "every day I'm getting bombarded by these questions from Friends one's wondering whether the market has bottomed on not and this person really wants to invest in gold and Arjun is worried whether he should stop his sip but I think she's just scared because you know the market could fall even more I know during Corona the market fell like what 38% and now the market is down only 133% I think the question you're really asking is should you invest right now or should you just exit actually let me show you a chart this is Nifty in 2024 it goes sideways it goes up Falls a little bit goes up it was a beautiful bull market and this is what looks like now for 5 months the market has been falling some people calling it a crash some people saying a recession may happen why did this happen to understand this you have to zoom out look at sensex from 1986 to 2024 you'll find something you've never seen before in 1986 we had the mounting fiscal deficit which caused a 41% fall there was a balance of payment crisis in ' 91 which is minus 39% there was the harad mea scam decline of 54% there was aom bubble in the year 2000 which was minus 56% we had a 2006 Market selloff there was the global financial crisis in 2008 which was a 61% fall and of course very recently we had the Corona virus pandemic which was minus 38% now the problem is you're not an economist you're not a research analyst you're not a hedge fund Trader with some algorithm which can tell you what stock to pick and choose you're a retail investor like you and me and I think we need a basic economics lesson here the economy is dynamic and so are the markets markets move in Cycles basically markets don't move in like a straight line like in The Last 5 Years Nifty has given returns of about 15% and then you'll see phases like this when there is a fall of many many months in in fact in some cases these Falls can be as steep as 39% and that's completely normal but if falling Market is normal then everyone should be investing right but the shocking truth is completely different look at this this is the Sip stoppage ratio which basically means how many people have stopped their sips look how high that is you'll notice when the market Falls people get fearful and they stop their sips but as the market is Rising people won't start investing immediately they need proof that the market is safe so unless you start moving up a lot or make new highs people don't really start investing more seriously and regularly which means we are going to play the market Through The Eyes of fear and not Through The Eyes of logic the advantage of a falling Market is simpler than you can imagine every time the market Falls it's actually a gift for the long-term investor let's suppose you invest 10,000 rupees every single month no matter what happens to the market and simply by doing this on this Excel calculator which I've given you in the description you can do this for yourself change that number you'll see an xir this is basically Returns the returns for this is so much but what if I stopped my sip when the market fell what would happen to this return let's find out so I'm opening the Sip over here and every time I notice the market fell just March 2020 if I scroll back to March 2020 I can actually delete this 10,000 rupees and Everything Will Change now I'll do this for all the falls in the last four five years and see what happens to the xir the returns are now drastically less you know why because every time I invested I only invested in the markets were going up when the market fell I could not average down so the summary is you should not stop your sip but the question Still Remains about lumpsum what about people who want to do a lumpsum or people who want to invest in particular stocks and that portfolio is really down here's what you should do we look at two data points and then I'll talk about how you should interpret those data points okay the first one is on a chart this is nifty50 index and I'll put three moving averages the first moving average is the shortest moving average this is as you can see your 30mon moving average because we on a monthly chart then is the most interesting the yellow moving average which is a 100 month moving average which means every 2 years one data point gets collected and then we have Beka which is 50 month moving average which is one data point every year and when the market comes here it's really really fairly valued now the problem is we are pretty far away from here how do you know Will the Market come to this moving average or this moving average or this moving average this is a question mark and I'll answer this question but we have the second point over here which is the Nifty price to earnings ratio it's very simple look at just the blue line over over here okay so the blue line over here at 42 shows that the market is very expensive and when the Blue Line comes down like over here 18.9 to you know the market is like fairly cheap so how do you know what is fair well the long-term average from 1999 to 2025 the current PE ratio average is about 20.8 to the median and the market is at 20.3 so is the market fairly valued here's how you interpret both of these data points I'll tell you through the story of 2020s market crash of Corona so if I look at the technical chart during Corona the market touched blue and touched yellow fine and then when I opened the p ratio around uh 2020 is where here the market was then priced at 25 and I knew the long-term average is 20 or somewhere around that I think it was 18 at that time so I thought 18 is average Market at 20 Market is crashed the world is crashing the world is burning so I should wait for the market to be fairly priced therefore I stopped any Investments and I waited for the market to fall because logically speaking looking at all the data the market should fall right and this was the biggest mistake nobody in the world including the biggest investor and the new rookie know what the market is going to do no amount of analysis no algorithm nobody knows all of these data points is to basically tell you all is well you don't have to do all of this maybe knowing this makes you feel secure but the safest thing to actually do is just do a freaking investment every single month and if the market Falls a little more maybe you can do a lump suum but trying to predict how much the market will fall even I couldn't do and I've been trading and investing since 2007 nobody knows this the reason I showed you this is when you show a lot of data people think intellectual and something interesting will happen but I pretty secure to tell you all of this is nice to hear and it's good information but it can never predict the market shut up and learn to invest every single month for the rest of your life you can thank me later",

    "title_current": "SIP or Loan Repayment: The F² Rule",
    "transcript_full": "A lot of my friends always ask me this question. They say, \"Pratik, I have loans that I have to pay off and I have a sip going on and the investment is growing. So when I get this extra money, an increment or a bonus, should I pay off the loan so that this actually reduces so I feel lighter or should I invest that money so this investment keeps growing?\" So today I'm going to answer it with these two scenarios and the fed formula. So let's assume that you have a home loan. Let's say it's about 20 years and that's your debt. So I'm going to put this in this calculator to actually show you what happens. The interest rate is about 8.5%, the loan amount is 40 lak rupees and like I said 20 years. So 240 months. So your EMI is roughly 34,000. So now we've assumed a home loan. You can change this to say a car loan or a personal loan and you change the number as per whatever is your situation. But we'll stick to this. Now let's say after 1 year after you take this loan you get an increment and now you can afford to invest 10,000 rupees extra and you want to invest this let's say in the stock market so there's a SIP I have a SIP calculator so instead of paying off the loan you start the SIP so I'll enter the SIP amount at 10,000 on the 13th month because that's when I got the increment so 10,000 rupees. Now if I look at Nifty average over the last many many years, you can see that I have um the years on the left from 2000 all the way to 2024 and on the right I have the annual returns. Of course, if you look at only certain areas, it looks like Nifty is fantastic, but you'll also have bad years. So the total CAGGR or the average return is about 11.7%. So I'll assume it's 11% for this. Now remember, we're calculating over decades and a lot happens over decades. There are a bunch of things that could happen. One, your salary could increase in the future. Well, hopefully it'll increase in the future. Second, you might get a bonus randomly in the future. Now, let's suppose in a particular month, the second year, third year, fourth year, that year, that month, you want to make sure you want to increase the 10,000 to 11,000, which is 10%. So all you need to do is come here put 10% and that will reflect your new reality. So you can actually add a step up here quite easily. So if you do a SIP starting the second year at 10,000 a month assuming a 11% return at the end of 20 years your SIP would have grown to 72 lakhs 33,366. Now this amount is our benchmark number. So when we run another scenario I want to beat this amount. If I prepay, if I invest, I should beat 72 lakhs, 33,000. Correct? So remember this number. But what if you took that money and prepaid the interest? Would you actually save more? But you know what happens when you actually pay a loan? You probably don't. And I have something cool to show you. Imagine that you have 10 blocks or 10 lakh worth of loans. So you have one, two. So now we have 10 blocks. Each block is one lakh. Now let's say you pay one block or one lakh in EMIs. So your loan is now worth how much? 9 lakhs, right? Completely wrong. It's almost still roughly very close to 10 lakhs. So any long-term loan that you have, the interest is actually deducted first. So let me show you what this looks like on a real loan of our home. 40 lakh rupees balance home loan EMI is 34,000 rupees you'll see that most of the money out of 34,700 28,300 is going towards interest and only 6,000 rupees is actually going towards this the actual principal. Then as time goes by this number keeps decreasing. The principal portion keeps increasing and at roughly 130 months you can see that they almost become equal before you actually start paying your principal more than your interest. This means for the first few years you're basically working for the bank because you're not paying a large amount of this yet. The interesting thing here is that when you prepay a loan, that amount straight away is reduced from the principal. So now instead of investing that 10,000 rupees in scenario one in the markets, imagine if you took that 10,000 rupees and prepaid every single month, how much money could you save in interest over the next few years? We can see that if we did this, our interest reduces from 43 lakh rupees, wait for it, to 25 lakhs. So you've actually saved a pretty good amount over here. You'd save 17.6 lakhs. Now a lot of people will tell you that 17.6 lakh rupees is exactly how much you save. But think about it. If we trying to figure out how much we saved, we should also deduct that 10,000 rupees that we're spending every single month. So let's deduct that as well. Let's be a little fair. And when you add all that up, it totals 13.8 lakhs. So the math is very simple. 17.6US 13.8 is a grand 3.87 lakhs. 3.87 lakhs is practically nothing. And I know what you're thinking right now. You think you figured it out, but you're actually wrong. You're thinking 3.87 lakhs is not a lot, so you should not prepay. you should invest because 72 lakhs say and this is where you are wrong. Let me explain why. One thing you haven't noticed is when you prepay a loan, you've actually instead of 20 years compress that time frame of the EMI to about 12.5 years. We'll use that time and we'll invest that in the market every single month to see what happened. So now I'll open my SIP calculator and in the 151st month that's 12 1/2 years I'll add 44,713 at an 11%. And let's see what happens if I pull this Excel sheet all the way to the 20th year. By the end of 20 years, your SIP would have been 61.1 lakhs extra and your total savings will be 65.17 after you include that three lakh that we saved. Not so bad after all, right? What you've not considered is risk. So before I actually reveal the final Excel sheet on what is the solution to this prepayment or investment, you should first understand the most important risk you probably haven't considered. And that is called sequence risk. Check this out over here. When you look at the returns of Nifty, all I want you to look at is on the left side you have years and then on the right side on the extreme you have the returns. Yes, the average return is 11.7%. But the sequence really matters. Supposing you started investing in 2008 and sold in 2015. The return would have been a grand 3.28%. This means the returns are unpredictable. You don't know how much you'll actually average even over say 10 15 years. But the payment in the EMI that's guaranteed. So doesn't it make sense that you take that money and actually prepay? Because if you prepay you're guaranteed saving some money. Again, you are slightly wrong. So, I'm going to explain this to you in scenario three, the ideal case. Now, think about it. You can't just prepay everything because then you won't have any growth capital. Like, what do you do with money growing in case there's an emergency? And you can't also take all of your money invested in the market because you'll always have this tension and stress of paying the EMIs. In both cases, if you do them, you'll still be stressed. You need a balance between the two. So, what should you do? The answer is the F square rule or the freedom fund rule. Now you could do 60 40 30 70 that's your call but try to do some of both. You can decide what you want to do and this Excel sheet is really going to help. So over here all you need to do is put in the type of loans that you have and the percentage and you will know exactly what you should do. It's fully automated. You don't need to do much. On the right side it'll tell you whether you should invest more or you should prepay more. And based on this more you can decide how much you want to do. Now if you have a situation where your interest is more than 15%. You should actually focus on prepaying that loan first because even the market will give you 10 11%. So what's the point in investing when you have such a large outstanding you know when you look at these excel sheets you think that you have figured out life when you drag those cells downwards and you get a nice number. To be honest personal finance and money in particular actually has nothing to do with Excel sheets. When you enter someone's newly bought house, you think, \"Wow, he's winning life.\" And another person would enter the same house and think, \"Wow, this guy has a loan that's going to last 20 years and he absolutely has to work to pay the EMI.\" One of it feels like a pindra, a cage balm. The other one you feel proud. You tell your mother, your parents, everyone, I own a home. So the stories that you tell yourself really, really matter. I want you to write down in the comments or somewhere in your notebook on how do you define freedom.",

    "transcript_full": "[Music] I'm sick and tired of this there's no way I can make money I've tried everything in my account balances well never mind I tried gold I looked at Equity as an investment what's this Forex Trading in an app this is uh quite interesting I think the best part about this is that I have Global access to any Marketplace in the world I mean Pisa he PESA but you know what I get 1,000x Leverage What does that mean very simply put when I want to place a trade all I need to do is deposit $100 let's say 8,000 rupees and I can trade up to 80 lakhs 8,000 rupes deposit 80 lakh trade p p so you see I have cracked the code on how to make money and all I have to do is choose the direction do I think Market will go up do I think Market will go down very simply put I have a machine to make all this money but you know what's best how do I trust such an app because this app I'm talking about is endorsed by [Applause] celebrities that's right so I think the solution is very simple forget about everything download the app now and get $1,000 just for downloading it you see these Jordans he light hm something was definitely wrong with that testimonial Forex Trading platforms make you believe that money making is so simple the UI is so Sleek the money just happens so easily and it just looks so tempting but how is it even possible so we thought in this episode we'll de influence Forex Trading platforms we'll talk about the good we'll talk about the bad cuz these guys definitely won't and we'll go through the entire process from opening an account all the way to the riches let's start with step number [Music] one so let's actually take the user Journey so whatever ads we see on the internet we basically follow One of Those ads and basically I can download their mobile application off a Forex Trading platform and let's see what happens let's do this together so I'll download it and I can see the account opening is free there are no charges okay and then um they even teach you how to place trades now I have to be honest this looks beautiful like the app itself the UI it just looks so sleek and nice and I'm sure they do this to increase trust because if something looks good people trust it a little more but okay and what I'll do is we can see that you get 1,000x leverage 1,000x leverage this means for whatever money you have USA 1,000x you can actually trade with and this is sold as a feature which means if I put in $100 8,000 rupees times 1,000 leverage that is 80 lakhs so with just 8,000 rupes I can access or trade with 80 lakh worth of whatever I'm trading so so why don't we place actually $100 and I'll take 1,000x leverage and I have to predict predict where the market will go the market will either go up or down so let me pick up and I pick and we can see that the trade has begun we can see the movement this this doesn't this feel exciting can't you feel the thrill with me and the account just just went to zero in seconds you know why because when I took a 1,000x leverage my profit and loss is also calculated on the 1,000x that means it's not calculated on the 8,000 rupes the $100 it's calculated on 80 lakhs so. 1% let me say that again 0.1% of 80 lakhs is equal to my Capital so all that needs to happen is the market fluctuates like it does by .1% and my entire capital is wiped out no stop- loss no strategy nothing will work here because you are overleveraged your money in the account has finished so this trading platform exited and I have basically become zero in seconds as a Trader you should never take leverage Leverage is a double-edged sword you look at it from a positive perspective but it also has this negative side so unless you're really really experienced and don't know how to use leverage you should never use it now these trading platforms are actually called cfds or contracts for difference so what are cfd platforms cfd is an interesting idea on paper but before you understand that let's understand how a normal broker works right here in our country in India when you want to buy one share of say HDFC Bank you place a buy order on the stock exchange now this happens by the broker interface but the point to be noted is you're placing the order on the exchange once you find a seller and that order matching happens remember this happens on the exchange level not the broker level once that matching happens a trade is executed so a stock exchange is a place where stock exchanges and Order matching happens based on bids and asks and then of course we have all these intermediaries around this to ensure and Safeguard you now let's look at how a CFT platform does its trade so you want to trade abroad you want to have access to all markets could be European could be South American could be American could be Canadian could be who knows what but you want international access so the first thing the cfd platform does is register himself inside a country which has lack rules and regulations so no one's really looking if they break a few rules like Biz or Cyprus or one of these places once they've done this they will open accounts with the US broker with a European broker so on and so forth and let's say you deposit an amount with the cfd platform what they'll do is when you want to purchase say Nike shares they'll take that money purchase it with the US broker and show a ledger entry to you on your UI that you now own one sh share of Nike remember the Nike shares that you bought were bought through the cfd platform the cfd platform placed in order with this us broker and to the US broker the owner is not you it's that CFT platform and the money you put is also owned by that cfd platform now the biggest problem here is that if there's a dispute who will you really go to it's based in a country with really lacks rules anyway this is how they give you Global access and compare this to what happens in in India when you bought those shares of HDFC bank they were actually held by you in your name in a demat account regulated by intermediaries and making sure that nothing goes wrong in case there's an issue this is how an evolved Market works and how say us also works but in the cft's case this entire chain of command has changed now everything was going really well for these cfd Platforms in the '90s things were going well you had Traders you had investors people would open accounts they evolv their advertisement people would Place orders they would place it in the country show a ler balance and things were good and the way that the cfd platforms earned was via spread they didn't charge a brokerage there was a spread between the buy and sell and that's how they made money but over the years they had another idea to make money apart from the spread they looked at all their Traders and noticed almost all of them were losing money eventually so what if they became the trader on the other side which means there is no exchange happening you simply take the opposite position of whatever your customer puts so if he's trading currencies and he buys them you simply take the opposite position that's a sell the actual trade with another Trader never happens this meant the platform is not a intermediary anymore it's become sort of an exchange by itself it's become its own regulator it's become its own Clearing Corporation it's become everything in a country that does not have crazy good laws that's a problem so now let's imagine you and me both of us we own one of these cfd platforms and we have to make money and dude the only way we can make money is if our customers lose because in this case I'm not charging a brokerage I don't care about the spread we are trading against them it's totally legal by the way because this country doesn't care the first thing we can do is give them lots of Leverage 10x 20x no just give them hundreds of X of Leverage and as soon as there is some fluctuation in the market take them out which means all of the money that they put in the trade is now ours nice the second thing is we'll run a lot of ads to show them in testimonials that money can be made and we should gamify it we should make it simple don't put all this limit stop loss simply ask them where do you think the market will go up or down and with that bet because this is essentially a bet and this is now a casino and we are the owners of the casino and the house always wins third point now you'll notice a lot of people clicked on our ad but a lot of them are not signing up so what should we do as soon as we open the account we'll just deposit $11,000 for them for free but ,000 guys it's a digital platform we'll just show $1,000 we won't let them withdraw it we'll simply say you can't withdraw right now you must deposit and trade before you're allowed to withdraw simple the $1,000 is not real it's bait for them to open the account and hopefully after some time they'll deposit money get addicted and that's how we can earn another terrible thing team 01 found while researching this is that the prices you see on these apps are not not even real they'll change them based on how they want to make money so if they want to show a lower price so you make losses they'll just do it really quickly or the opposite if you're shot my point is very simple it happens so quickly it'll feel like it happened for real but it's just designed to suck you into the scam and all your money out so now let's talk about the legalities in India first thing is cfd platforms are banned there's also a list by the RBI it falls under the alert list of all platforms you should be wary of links for both of these are in the description check them out for further reading we have a bunch of other links in the description do check that out tell me what you think the entire de influencing series all these episodes that we've actually done have one thing in common the people are selling greed to us and sometimes Somewhere In Our Lifetime we fall prey to it so tell me what you think about it and Our intention is to basically make sure you know what's good and bad because the internet can really be misleading what are the good things you liked in this episode please write in the comments 01 is a new age Media company that's trying to demystify money through datab backed storytelling so tell me what you liked and didn't like in this episode give me more suggestions of what you'd like to see in the future and see you in the next [Music] episode is through this is through this platform

    "transcript_full": "you can earn 20,000 rupees in just 3 minutes let me show you how if you want to become rich like me you should start color trading immediately the game's really very simple you have to choose between two colors red or green and let's say you selected green so if your bet is correct then your money will double simple right I invest all my money with the Duna app simply go to the website and start your color prediction Journey now and you can earn 1 lakh rupes profit a day and don't forget to join my private group on telegram where I will give you the prediction with 100% accuracy with calculation H is it even real okay something was definitely wrong with that influencer and that game color prediction is also called the color game or the color trading prediction game if you go to Instagram and search for the color trading hashtag like this you'll see more than three lakh posts color color trading oh yeah color trading so many of these videos have millions of views and the problem is color trading is a scam in fact if you look at this news report the Hyderabad police called out a color prediction scam in 2020 and the spoils totaled 1,600 crores so that's a large number and that's 2020 color trading is nothing new but the difference is now these guys are hiring influencers who have a decent following and these people used to do comedy dance videos Etc and now they only produce color trading videos usually they will show themselves with a lot of money having a great life and in the end they'll say join the color trading prediction game to make money just like them basically every single color prediction game out there is a scam it's there to dup your money but before we understand how the scam Works let's understand how this game works so the game is pretty simple and I've got to admit it sounds pretty exciting the entire game is about 3 minutes and you play for about 2 and 1 half minutes here's what happens you see this on the screen and you have to select either a number or a color now let's suppose the first 2 and a half minutes you do your calculation you go to the telegram channels you do a bunch of stuff and you predict what the next outcome is going to be let's say I choose one of the above and after 2 and 1/2 minutes the computer takes 30 seconds to generate a random number so 2 and a half minutes is when you can decide another 30 seconds of wait anticipation and a little bit of anxiety for the computer to spit out the answer so if you selected a number and you were correct your money will 10 x if you selected purple and purple came out your money will 5x and if you selected a color red or green and were right your money will 2x so basically in 3 minutes your money can go from 2x to 10x and if you're wrong you lose all of the money but that's okay the opportunities from 2x to 10x isn't that amazing then you have YouTube videos which actually have strategies on how to win this game now you'll think there's red and there's green what strategies these guys have mathematical formulas and rules which make you feel make you feel like you have done something and you can get the right answer every time they go like guys the game number of the last bet was 3,213 and today's date is 27th July the next bet will be placed at 5:00 p.m. so if you add the last two digits of the last game with 27 and divide it by 5 you will get the winning number and if you open the comments of any of these reals or videos you'll notice a lot of them say this please help recover our loss and the reason why all of them are losing is the same reason why the influencers are incentivized to do it they get paid a referral fee when the victim loses money but how does the app actually make money simple there's a platform fee or a Comm fee if you put in 1,000 and that 1,000 became 2,000 you don't get 2,000 you get 1,900 because it must seem like there has to be some way that the company's making money so to portray itself as a legitimate company it charges this platform fee but this is not how actually the app makes money the reality is completely different so let's understand how the scam works the first thing you need to do is go to Google and ask how do you download or create your own color Trading app you can actually buy the entire code base for 3,000 rupees all you need now is to send users and start playing the game and here is where the fun begins so the first dangerous thing over here is that when you transfer a money to any of these kind of websites this is what happens a random UPI code generates and you're sending it to a random company every single time we actually tried it and we saw these random companies being generated so it's possible that you transfer something and it just does doesn't reflect in your color trading account but anyway let's assume you transfer the money and it does get reflected in your account let's see how these apps scandle since this guy is new to color trading he joins the first game by betting rupees 1,000 he bets his money on red and he's won 2,000 Rupees the victim is now confident and he puts in more money more money and more money and keeps winning again and again and again and at this moment he invests 50,000 Rupees in the game and after doing all the necessary calculations he's sure that the next color will be red so he bets all of his money well on red and the victim is confident that in the next 30 seconds he'll have 1 lakh rupees and he can buy those nice things and the result is coming in three 2 1 and we've got green what the victim has lost all of his money but how could this happen he's never lost before this happened because there is someone in the back end who's monitoring this very game to make sure that the color with the biggest bet actually loses the game it's part of the entire plan you see in this particular game 10 people had participated six of them had bet a combined total of 1.5 lakhs on red and four people had bet a combined total of 45,000 on green that's why the admin sitting in the back end made green win because he received combined total of 1.95 lakhs and since green won he just needed to pay out 90,000 giving him a profit of 1.05 lakhs plus the commission he gets from those 90,000 and that's why these games are designed to make you lose money cuz you can never really predict what number or color will actually happen and these guys ensure that they make a lot of money by making maximum people lose money and you know how they do this by hiring influencers now the influencers aren't only responsible for sending you to the app and joining it they also make you part of a private Channel where they share what the next number or the next prediction is going to be with a very high accuracy rate now since thousands of people are part of these games everyone mostly bets on one color or one number skewing the entire game which means once the admin knows all of the number or most of the money is in green he'll make that number or that color lose maximizing his profit and the influencer's profit now for a moment let's assume that you placed a bet somewhere and you did win after all some people do actually win just based on prob ility and your 10,000 becomes 20,000 rupees and you think I have to withdraw the 20,000 rupees so you simply need to put your bank account details and withdraw it right right not in this case two things could happen one they could simply block your account and say you cannot withdraw it or two they can say refer a friend and once he starts playing and puts in money then I'll allow you to withdraw the money now in both cases you're either adding user to the business therefore adding more money to their business or you just give away your cash because they have an issue and I'm not making this up we actually found someone in the office who went through this they won something and wanted to withdraw but he was not allowed to withdraw the money here is the message he got from the admin who said it's not possible talk to your bank not my fault sorry but again like I said you are unlikely to be scammed by something like this but someone in your life is so so because you're part of the 01 Community can you promise me you'll talk to at least one person who you think could become a victim and tell them in person",

oh okay so you manage Instagram right yeah okay so let's say I gave you two Targets first Target you have to increase the number of followers okay we go from say 25,000 followers to 75,000 followers second target existing audience you have to engage and uh tell them about taxes because tax filing season is happening you have to engage the existing audience so what will your strategy be for these two objectives so for followership of course it's going to take a few months because it cannot happen overnight it'll increase gradually and engagement we can work on a few posts that can start right away they have different time frames and you have obviously different strategies it's exactly like investing but for money so now let's suppose you make that big ward of cash that you'll make when you're 60 years old now finally you have Financial Freedom exciting no yeah exactly you don't want to have all this money on your 60 because you want to have a lot of you want to have some money now and then a little more after a little more time then a little more after a little more time so you can spend it right what would you buy if you had to buy right now what would you spend your money on you Europe trip Europe trip okay so that'll cost something let's say 1.5 lakhs or so what else M maybe a car in the future but you just drove this morning no is that that car that's my dad's car oh I

you're going to do with money so let's say you're about 25 right now around I know you're a little older close to around 25 um and let me add another let's say 30 over here just so it's easy to remember and I'll go all the way over here till 60 where I should I put 40 where I should I put 50 let's say 50 is somewhere here and let say 40 is somewhere here cool now what we have to figure out is as your life is progressing you don't want all the money to come here yeah right you want enough money to live your life so your first goal was Europe do you want it here no here no here no here yes perfect what else is your goal house so let's say around 40 you want a house can you give me the amount what the house would be what a the Europe would be 1.5 lakh 2 lakh so let me say 2 lakhs because if you're doing it a few years from now the prices may go up a little bit so let's say it's 2 lakhs house what do you think the price is going to be really tough to say right a good way to start is to ballp it so are you going to buy a 10 CR house no are you going to buy a 10 lak rupe house no what do you think is acceptable I think by the I'm have 42 maybe 2 maybe not sure it's totally fine the first thing you should do is write that number number and then we can rationalize it later so for now I'll put 2 CR now you should also add other goals over here maybe iPhone but you already have that the office gave one to you personal also personal but you may add other goals over here as well okay now I understand goals but what about index funds H one minute one minute so let's suppose you start saving money every month for that Europe trip first month you save 10,000 second month you you're up to 20,000 month you're 30,000 so in 2 years you're at 2,000 basically in less than 2 years you save enough to get to this 2 lak number now the thing is 2 years is a very small time frame let's assume your goal was something else and it is a four five 7 year long time frame goal the better way to do it is to actually invest a certain amount of money into an index fund which we'll talk about right now just for that goal okay so you know that I'm going to invest in this fund for the next 7 years to hit X goal but like how will I know how much time it requires for me to reach that goal how do I decide all of those things but wait how will you figure out what you'll need for these goals in 3 years 5 years or 10 years so for that we have a future calculator so first we have current price then we have inflation and then you have number of years all you need to do is put in these numbers of what the current price is leave the inflation as it is and put a number of years you'll automatically know what the future value is for example this home for 50 lakh rupees is 81 lakhs in 10 years so you know you have to plan for 81 lakhs guys in the same way you can do this for your goals on everything else you want and once you know this you can now know what could be your sip amount or the monthly investment you'll have to make to reach that goal but how will you do it we have a sip calculator for you see your goals over here put in the Target amount remember this is the inflation adjusted amount okay the future value then you put in the return on investment we've assumed index returns 12% and we're obviously assuming that you're investing for many many years and this brings us to a required monthly sip but I want you to notice we have international trip one and two but the return on investment is 8% can you tell me why I hope you guessed it that the investment period here is only 1 or 2 years and you can't invest in the stock market for a short-term Horizon so we assumed that you'll invest this in some form of debt so we've also reduced the investment to 8% and that's fine the Sip amount will increase a little bit but that's okay you can find this calculator in the description below check it out you can create a copy and put in your own numbers all right let's get back and see what Tanya has to say okay now that I have my sip clear where do I invest which Index Fund everyone says invest in one Index Fund what if we change this up a little bit made it a little spicy a little interesting so this is um nifty50 so as you can see um this is nifty50 going up look at that so it's gone from what level is over here 4600 all the way to 24,000 that's that's a lot now nifty 50 is the top 50 right what about like the next 50 like not the top 50 like say 51 to 100 what do you think about those group of stocks what's going to be different than the top 50 I think they'll be slightly riskier okay but like still good cuz 5200 is not bad yeah correct so actually that index also exists okay so let's check this out okay so this is covid fall so I'm going to pick CO's um lowest point and then come to today's highest point and I can see that the market went up 2 29% 2 29% now what I'll do is I'll open the next 50 which is 51 to 100 so just type Nifty next or it's also called Nifty Junior oh Junior now let's click on Nifty Junior now chartwise of course it looks very similar M little different does it look a little different look pretty similar yeah it's a little different but what I'll do is let me now measure from this covid lowest point all the way to today is that 36% higher than higher than Nifty senior why do you think this happened probably because these companies also have potential and they grew and they're smaller so they have a smaller base Rel relatively so chances of them growing a little faster is higher will it always happen no not at all is Nifty Junior more volatile or does it move more than Nifty senior nifty50 yes it is it also means that when the market Falls which one do you think is going to be more crazier from the two junior junior and which will be more stable senior nifty50 correct um but the gains look nice so how would you balance this maybe you get majority in senior and a little amount in junior yeah it's not called senior guys but yeah cool it's fine so you could mix and match it right so like you could do 80% of your sip value in nifty50 and 20% in junior yeah if you like a little more risk you could do 50/50 you could do 60/40 you could do 7030 but the point is you have a stable asset in the center which takes most of your money so stability is there in this case it's Nifty and then you have a smaller investment which is slightly more riskier relatively speaking it has a little more risk so you could have a little bit of nifty Junior as well so it would look like this right so you would have a center of say give me a number 70% yeah okay you comfortable with that 70% does nifty 50 50 and then you have a smaller investment of 30% in junior H and this looks like a planet actually right this looks like a planet this looks like a moon this is actually called core satellite investing most of the money is the core which is Nifty 70% and 30% could be junior you've actually invested in the top 100 companies in the country yeah for example I'm doing this weight loss challenge right now okay so 70% is diet and 30% is exercise and that's how we reach our goal yeah that's right and there's also a core Inver bad joke yeah correct correct that's how you reach your goal exactly so is this the best portfolio in the world I don't know is this the best place to start 100% because can you optimize this further of course you can you can do a bunch of other stuff the code can be completely different the satellites can be completely different in many cases people have multiple satellites many cases people do something completely off but this is a great place to start as a first step okay I understand that I have to put in all the extra money that I have and put it in these two funds and I'm sorted what did you say all your money most my money okay so what we just did was this core satellite thing right yeah but you have to zoom out a little bit because there a bunch of other asset classes as well so Nifty is what asset index no equity so when you're investing in Nifty you're investing in equity which is one of the highest risk asset classes out there okay there are other asset classes as well can you name me a few gold yeah gold that's right real estate real estate bonds bonds debt correct okay so what you ideally should do is of course when you start off you can't really diversify into all these different because you don't have enough money so I understand that but over a period of time you should have some money in different assets ideally that they're not correlated to each other too much so that you know if the equity Market completely plummets all your wealth also doesn't go away with it even if it's temporary so maybe later on cuz the 10 minutes are way over um we'll talk about these other asset classes and how you can divide them so don't just post on Insta also post on YouTube LinkedIn Twitter right yeah it's start cool correct hope you like this episode if you have any questions put in the comments below now you should also add other goals over here maybe iPhone but you already have that the office gave one to you probably definitely cool surely follow please okay thank you",

abhishek should i take a youtube master class to increase credit score whatever dear abhishek thank you for applying for a car loan with us unfortunately we are unable to upload your loan application at this time due to your low credit score we encourage you to improve your credit score and reapply in the future low credit score abhishek's low credit score something is definitely wrong sir kai sir sir i need your help i'm working right now not arin nahi sir i need your help patamiji what are you doing sir phone emi done all credit card payments done no minimum payments but still my credit score is low hold on hold on just paying your emis on time does not ensure that your credit score is high actually there's this four c's framework right if you do all the four c's then your credit score will be high what are these four c's i'll quickly tell you the four c's but i'll also give you this kit so you can use that kit to make sure your credit score is high cool okay let's begin so why were you checking your credit score adi sir i want to buy my car the color accessories everything but you know what happened what happened sir my bank rejected my loan and another bank was offering me a loan but at high interest rate because i have a low credit score how low 680 650 and how long did it take to fall where was it before 780 so it fell over 6months six months yes six months how did you let that happen i mean didn't you check-in between his credit score kai mera you can't check your credit score everyday no that will make the score fall hey dude no no no no no that's a myth checking your credit score will reduce my credit score this is not true dude there is there are two types of checks okay there's a soft check and there's a hard check okay when you check your credit score it's a soft check and it's completely fine for you to check how much your credit score is affect my score you can check it pretty often but not every day but there is another kind of check called a hard check and you can guess what this is when you apply for a loan to a bank the bank needs to see whether you're credit worthy or not that means if i have paid my bills on time etcetera etcetera exactly imagine if you're one of those guys who's taken four loans and has never paid anything will he give you the loan no right of course not and what if you're one of those guys who's paid every single bill on time for the last six years that's me so that way they're more likely to give you the loan so they wanna check the credit history so they will ask the credit bureau like experian or cibil what a credit score is now when this is done to get a loan this is called a hard check and yes of course that affects your credit score understood likoisco liko what you can check and should check your credit score two i don't know why your credit score hey one minute you have to write it adi tell me this how many loans did you apply for for this suv like did you go to multiple banks yes i knew it how many banks five perfect five slow clap are you because they were not giving me don't do that select one bank see if you like it apply wait to get it hold up you don't need to do it in multiple places if they reject it so i'll go to another bank you could but you should space it out but they shouldn't reject it actually your credit score should be okay harissa how can i soft check my credit score it's actually not that complicated i had made this kit for myself i'll send you that kit and i'll put it in the description as well it'll tell you exactly how to soft check and see what your credit score is okay it'll also explain all the parts of the report so you should know how to actually read the report and what it means so it's pretty useful sir if not i have a better option okay listen to me i feel this is gonna be a bad option it's a good option you'll you you'll just listen to me i'll get a credit card okay i'll i'll push all my other expenses that is groceries travel etcetera etcetera on the card okay bank on me some salary will be left correct and i'll use that salary to pay the emis oh wow and then you'll get your car yes and you'll travel and you'll get everything perfect idea this is called the ultimate bankruptcy plan here's what happened you've already taken such a large loan have you heard of the credit card debt cycle what is it so you know that apple effect what's apple effect the apple effect where you buy one watch then a new watch comes out you buy airpods then the new airpods come out and you always want something new correct it's exactly the same in the credit card industry they take out a new credit card it has amazing benefits then they shut the benefits down and then there's a new credit card and you want to get a new credit card and it never ends but you know there's a problem here because the way credit is calculated when you shut down a old card which has a lot of transactions okay basically the algorithm reduces your credit score temporarily for some time so it's like rewarding you for like new debt it's not transactions as in completed transactions no yeah yeah what do you mean credit score okay so i'll just enjoy so you're saying you don't need a loan in the next ten years kids marriage maybe you're gonna get a maybe you're gonna get a house in the future dude you may not have that goal now but if the opportunity presents and the situation presents where you need to buy it your credit score should be okay right aditu you tell me what should i do just look at your credit utilization ratio basically you should not take too much loan simple but now let me quantify it with the formula imagine you have two credit cards five 5 lakhs 5 lakhs so what is your total available limit 10 lakhs 10 lakhs you should not use more than 3 lakhs that's 30% and and if you have one card of 1 lakh rupees then you shouldn't use more than 30 lakh rupees so basically add all your credit card limits so that's your total available limit you should not go beyond 30% of your limit now all of us think i have 10 lakh rupees i can spend $5.06 $7.08 lakhs but that's not a good thing you don't want to be over leveraged basically 30% is a safe number if your credit utilization is really high like seventy eighty 90% it will fall of course it will fall remember no one really knows the actual algorithm and the actual rules of how credit score is calculated it is always being updated but based on experiences we can tell these are some things you should do not only for your credit score but for your personal financial health also perfect sir last one last c what's the fourth c are you ready yes number four is good credit mix you don't want silk credit card eventually you'll get a home so that's a home loan eventually you'll get a car car loan okay so it's a car loan remember these are asset backed so if you don't pay the emi you can actually pay back using the asset in a credit card there's no asset so unsecured so you you you don't want too much unsecured debt over there you want a mix of secured and unsecured the most important thing is to actually go and use all of this in real life so go to the description see the checklist we'll talk about it right now paste it in front of your workstation or at your home see it and actually do it let me read it for you the first one is i wrote only open credit accounts when necessary to avoid lowering my credit score and appearing risky to the lenders second diversify your credit types gradually by adding different types of credits then always make timely payments to maintain good credit score this is like basic keep credit card balances low and make sure you're not using more than 30% also for me it was useful to pay the credit card ten days before it's due if you find that's difficult that means you're taking too much credit it's actually interesting no ki agar paise nahi hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai hai ha actually had two loans of a massive amount which were not paid on her cibil score and her cibil score actually tanked this is a true story ma'am oh and then she wrote to cibil and said these are not my loans then cibil went to the bank the bank said yes we don't have no records of this and they removed it that's when the credit score went up so that's the checklist and remember even your employers can check your credit score even some positions like bank pay as a minimum credit score and you know what else you should know you guys aren't commenting something say something nice in the comments and see you in the see you in the next episode like and subscribe and bye bye let me get into the zone how will i know you are in the zone sir",

    "transcript_full": "Suddenly everyone in office wants to buy a car. So I found something interesting and that's the 20% rule. Look at this Excel sheet here. This Excel sheet will calculate your affordability. But the second calculator is the most important calculator which is the T AZ calculator. Let's start with the affordability calculator first. First you put your annual income which is 10 lakh rupees. I've assumed over here you can obviously change it. Then you put in your income tax to get your net income. Now in this case there is no income tax so we'll let it be at 10. Then we'll put the price of vehicle X showroom. I'm putting 15 lakh rupees but remember X showroom means exclusive of all other taxes. So you have to include it. Call up your car dealership. Ask them onroad price. Get that breakup and include it and put it in this Excel sheet. So we have road tax and others. If you're getting accessories other things put in, please add all those costs. Then we have expected down payment. Now generally the expected down payment is 20% of your total onroad cost which in this case is adding these two up 20% is roughly 3.2 lakhs. The loan tenure and the interest loan. Make sure you get the exact details from your bank so you know what to enter here and you'll finally get the magical number which will haunt you for the next 5 years. Emma amount 26,882 has been debited from your account. Platform number 8. Now let's see the running cost. Most people actually don't calculate this. So if you have say I have already calculated in the comments because now I want you to think that the fuel cost per year is 47,000 and over a lifespan it's 3.3 lakhs. The value of your car that you paid 16 lakh rupees and you're spending 3.3 lakhs on just the running cost. Now what I'll do is I'll divide the fuel cost per year by 12. I'll get 3,929. I will add the fuel cost and the monthly EMI. That means your EMI is not 26,882. It is 26,000 plus the fuel cost which is 30,800. So almost 31,000 mentally. But actually it's 31,000. That's a big difference. And I've not added the other costs yet. Now let's move on to the part we all hate but we must do because the government says we must do it, which is insurance and maintenance. So the insurance premium is 25,000 rupees. Please make sure you try to get a zero depth insurance because it's really really useful. Don't just get a third party insurance. The annual maintenance cost about let's say 25,000. Then you take these two numbers multiply them by 7 years to get your lifespan cost. So that is 1 lak 75 + 1 lakh75. I'll add this total yearly cost and then I'll just divide it by 12 months to see what is this extra cost that I'm adding. Oh, interesting. So this is being added to 4,167 rupees a month. Wow. So if I add my previous EMI to this new cost, suddenly my every month cost is now almost 35,000. Now let's go to additional costs. You have annual parking expenses. Now I know this is different for everyone but I have to assume something. So I've assumed 10,000. I've also assumed some tolls over here. which family trip you'll go somewhere because on Saturday night you felt like having those muta parathas and you left at night you paid the toll made unbelievably great memories so we have to add those cost and now we have a lifespan cost let's also add this and see what we get 10 + 10 and then I'll put these curly brackets and I'll divide it by 12 months because this is a yearly cost and I've got 1,667 so I'll add this my previous EMI to this expense. Now I know my EMI is now 36,644 rupees. Now let's look at the total ownership summary. You have a buying cost, you have running cost, you have insurance, you have additional cost. The total cost of ownership is not 16 lakhs as you thought. It's actually 27 lakhs 52,943 rupees. So we can see in the Excel sheet we already have annual cost of owning a car is 3 lak 93,000 and some rupees affordable no why is it saying no because it's not 20% of your disposable income and disposable is basically the salary you get after tax but my salary will also increase no your salary so you're saying if your salary increases then it becomes more affordable yes okay so let's do something let's also include inflation since you're also including salary. So I'll assume salary increment of 8%, I know a lot of you are very good and you'll get more than this but please let's be realistic 8%, inflation we'll keep at five. Actually let's keep it at 6%. Now let's turn this into a 7-year table and see and compare your expense to your income and see what is the affordability then. So year 1 to 7 I have net income this is increasing by 8% every year. That means we started with 10 lakhs and by seventh year it's almost 16 lakhs. Ah beautiful. Then we have down payment. This is the same. The down payment and EMI stay the same. We have the running cost which let's assume increases by 6% a year. Then we have insurance and maintenance. Insurance will stay the same but maintenance can increase a little bit. So I'll make the increase in this little gradual but there is some increase. additional cost also gradual increase and we have the total cost. Now the last column is the most important and it will show you the percentage of your net income versus how much you're spending on the EMI. But remember this affordability calculator is not as important as the TAZ calculator which I'll do next. So you can see it goes from 37% all the way to 26%. I still think it's kind of high cuz it should be under 20% as much as possible. So now there are two ways to actually solve this issue. The first is if you change u some of these variables like the cost of the car obviously everything comes down. So if I change the 16 lakhs to say 12 everything changes. Another option is to actually change the down payment from 20% to a much larger number. So let me change this 20% to say 40%. These two things once you change that you do a higher down payment and you do a smaller car you actually affect your overall EMI a lot and you can see that the percentage of net income now has come down to 29%. Now you have to keep adjusting these variables until this becomes around 20%. Remember the higher down payment you're able to pay the less the EMI becomes the interest also reduces and the pressure to pay every month a large sum also decreases. Now it's time for the interesting bit, which is the T A Z calculator. Actually, um, can someone take this cuz we don't need this calculator anymore. I need you to find a notebook and a piece of pen and paper. And I want you to draw a line between it. And on the right, write the stuff you want to own, like an iPhone, Jordans, and so on. On the left side, I want you to write three to four experiences that you think are out of this world. Don't go too crazy, but go a little crazy. And if it's between 1, one and a half lakhs, it's probably just the sweet spot. Put those experiences in and see if you can actually afford them. In most cases, if you plan, you will be able to. Now, I want you to next to these write a rating of what do you think is amazing. We actually did this with a bunch of people in the office and people started rating the experiences higher and the things lower and everyone paused for a moment and said why are you making me do this? I said I wanted to understand whether you want to own things or whether you want to experience things and everyone said we love and the younger people said we love and we want to live that life. Then I said, if you're optimizing for experience, then why are you thinking about owning stuff? Because when you have an EMI, you won't be able to do any of these things from 20s to say 40s. You have lots of energy and you can actually do things. Shouldn't you be optimizing for experiences, things no one is doing, things only you can do because you have the freedom of cash? Once you figure that you can optimize life for experiences, nothing feels the same. Everything changes because now you're leading a life with an inner compass with something that gives you happiness. Your work becomes better. You're better with your partner. You actually produce more creatively because you feel a life which is more fulfilled. I want you to think about what these experiences are. Tell me in the comments because once you experience this, the only thing you will ever think about Is this a [Music] [Applause] [Music]",

    "transcript_full": "Here comes the money. [music] >> No, no, no, wait. No fancy intros, no cool music. I just want to give you one simple video where you can get your 2026 money resolutions done and you can do them today and you'll get results today because patience and consistency. We'll first start with hygiene hacks, then move to losing less money, making more money, and some hacks that actually go beyond wealth because it's more important than just Excel sheets. So, I'm going to challenge myself to finish this under 13 minutes. And I want you to write down the hacks that actually were useful to you. So, let's move to hack number one. And much like this, remember you're going through your jeans pocket and extra sorrow. This is fake money. But imagine if it was actually real. What I'm talking about is unclaimed money from all these places over here from deposits to PF accounts to FDS that you forgot about or your parents forgot about or your grandparents forgot about that you can actually get claimed. You know this is 78,000 cr rupees and unclaimed deposits with banks have risen 26%. [music] This doesn't just include deposits. It also includes insurance money. So if there was a claim on insurance that was rightfully yours or for a family member that you didn't take out, you'll find that amount right [music] there. You can also see unclaimed shares. Very famously Reliance has some 8,000 I think 12,000 crores worth of shares which are unclaimed. In fact, there was an individual who found 11 lak rupees worth of Reliance shares through this method. Pretty cool. I think this hack also includes your PF money which is unclaimed when you are job hopping from one company to another and multiple PF accounts open. Then that amount can be lost because you know multiple accounts. So, all you have to do is go to the EPFO's website, follow these instructions, fill it in, and see if there's any unclaimed money in a different account, and it takes only a few minutes. Let's move on to the next hack. This is really useful and something no one does, and you lose money for no reason. So, listen carefully. One, if you have a credit card that you're not using, find out what the yearly charge is because they will bill you. Shut down that credit card if it is of no use for you today. Two, when you say join a job and you get a salary account with that job, then you have a bank account over there. Very nice, very convenient. But then if you shift your job and move somewhere else, then that account after 3 months of inactivity because salini turns into a normal savings account. Now, [music] savings accounts are different than a salary account. A savings account usually would require a minimum balance. If you don't have a minimum balance, which in many cases is not met, charges, and you're paying money for no reason. If you have an extra account somewhere, just shut it down because they'll charge you something for it. Next, the [music] same thing applies to DMAT accounts as well. I remember my dad had this relationship manager from this big bank and then they opened this DMAT account and then they said and dad continued paying these demat charges for year after year but he wasn't using that account he was using a different broker also on UPI it's a lot easier so if you if you use PTM or phone pay or any of the UPI apps there [music] is a place to see recurring UPI payments when you click on those you can see all the services and you [music] must look at these services to see which one you don't want some of these I have seen especially in my case I had a Netflix [music] autopay enabled which show 40 or 30 or some crazy number so just make sure that you want these uh recurring subscriptions in my case I actually found two subscriptions of the same company I was paying I don't know how that happened [music] but it happened so much for being personal finance teacher man I feel so I'm Pratik Singh your mentor do subscribe the button is down there. >> And you know what? We think but actually all of these numbers add up and most importantly it teaches you financial discipline to do a cleanup once a year. Maybe the cleanup takes an hour but it solves for the entire year and you go on a beat every single year and you become a financially disciplined person. It just costs a few hours. So let's move on to the next hack. God says very simple we'll divide this screen into two in the old tax regime you had this benefit of claiming some deductions on your overall income by doing a bunch of stuff in the new tax regime none of this is present everyone by default is on the new regime so if you did any of those taxsaving things like ATC etc then you should review once because you've already moved here do you need to switch back That's all it's going to take to do these hygiene checks. And you can do it right now. Get the result immediately in less than an hour. Now, we should move to hack number two, which is lose less money. And I love this one. So, if you're someone who has high loans, a little bit of loan or zero debt, yes, I said zero debt, these hacks will really help you. Imagine you're paying at a certain interest rate. that interest rate is compounding over 20 years against you because you are paying the interest but rates change. If the rates have become lower by a very large margin, you can actually get your house refinanced. Of course, there are some charges in between like processing etc. And we have a whole video explaining that process if that difference is worth it or not. But it may not happen every year. It's not going to happen every year. But when it does, it can save you so much money it's not even funny. But in case you do not have this refinancing option because rates have not reduced significantly then you can do another thing which is imagine this year zero year 20 when you pay an EMI most of the time you're actually paying through this line. Check it out. This is the principle. This portion over here is your interest. So imagine when you're paying a 20k EMI like a big number like 15 16k is just going to interest to the [music] bank which means your loan balance is almost the same after a couple of years. Very simple thing for you to do is you can't change this because this is how finance works. And to fight this evilness, what you [music] can do is just pay one extra EMI. And with these statistics, over a 10-year period, you save some 10 lakh rupees. Weirdly counterintuitive, but very good hack. The next hack is about communication. I was actually talking to Nishita right now. She she's a writer and she's telling me her friend has [music] 4 lakh rupees of credit card debt. she's probably paying 30 40% in interest on that debt that she is now [music] paying. A better use is taking money from your savings or FD paying [music] that debt. Now you might say I don't have that money that's why I use credit card but I'm sure your parents do. If you have the communication ability to go and talk to them and say papa mommy I have this whole [music] lak debt can you give and pay this off for me? I will pay you back at a 10% interest. Maybe [music] they'll appreciate that you're becoming financially prudent. So my friend Nishita, she asked her friend. She didn't talk to her parents. [laughter] She's still paying the credit card company. >> Also, the RBI allows you to change the billing cycle. [music] So if you think your credit card due date doesn't match with when you actually get your salary [music] and that's creating an issue, you can actually change this at least once. The next hack is very important. Even if you have zero debt, you should do this. So you should pull your FCR, your full credit report at least once a year to find out all the loans you have. What if someone took a loan in your name and you have no clue? Sounds theoretical. Until [music] now when we were discussing this, Swati said, which I didn't know. Now imagine a situation where you did not write an email to the credit bureau and loan Yeah, loan reject and because of that the points have gone down. Who's going to suffer? You. So, you can do this check once a year if everything is fine. So far, we've done hygiene checks and actually saving money. But what about making cash, making the moola? So, this section we'll talk about hacks where you can actually make more money. Every single fund will offer two types, a direct and a indirect or actually called a regular fund. The regular is through a partner, maybe through a financial intermediary or through an adviser. And there is a commission that this person takes to earn from it. Maybe they're advising you, helping you make better choices, making you stick, etc. Stick to this. If you're a totally do-it-yourself investor and there's no one you talk to, then switch your existing mutual funds in direct mode. You will save money. And how? Let me explain. If you see the top five funds based on their CAGGR, [music] this is the difference between a direct plan and an indirect called a regular plan. [music] Look at this very carefully. Yes, this is how much you actually save. So direct plan would save some 14,000 rupees in 5 years. Doesn't sound like a lot but over 30 years this number becomes 42.5 lak rupees. So how do you check this? On your email when you get information about your mutual fund it will specify whether it's direct or regular. If you can't find this you can actually go to this website [music] and you can get a consolidated account statement and basically you'll get a list of all the mutual funds that you've invested in in one place and [music] you can check the status right there. If you're doing this for the first time, it might take some time, but I promise you, you have to do this once. Even if you spend 20 minutes on it, it is fully fully fully worth it. The next hack is earning a couple crores more by making a small change every single year. Now, hopefully your salary increases every year and I think your expense to definitely increases every year. What [music] doesn't increase is your SIP. We often see these crazy numbers on calculators 1 cr rupees with just 10,000 rupees sip but the fine print actually says step up sip but when it comes to stepping up the sip we don't because um we forget kala step up did you decide can you see all the changes that are happening now I want you to do the most important hack of them all right here take a deep breath >> [sighs] >> Here's what [music] you got to do. Find out your first pay, your first pay slip. Now, compare that number to how much you made this very month. Compare the two. You, my friend, have actually made progress. But this money can go back to zero if you don't do these three things. Yes, that was a rehook. [clears throat] I have to make sure you do these three things or that'll be an issue. Use your free or discounted corporate health checkup. Talk to your HR, find out if she can provide this because usually the health insurance they're providing with you is already clubed with it. And according to the new labor laws, they have to do this. Even if you're under the age of 40, they'll usually have this benefit. And in case your HR says, \"Yaso, we do not provide this.\" Then ask your existing personal healthcare provider, whoever is the insurance company. [music] The next hack is about updating your nominees on all the accounts. Let me tell you a hard truth. [music] Most of what you're going to earn in your lifetime, you're not going to spend because of fear, anxiety, because you don't need it, because you want the money to compound, blah blah. So please, once a year, make it a habit to update all the nominees. Imagine you make all this wealth or assets etc. And there is this fight going on with officials because the nominees is not updated. Not fair, right? So you can do this check out the nominees. I had made this mistake on my account where I had put in the wrong nominee because it was a 10-year-old account. I got it updated to complicated but at least I got that done. And the last [music] hack is quite simple actually. I want you to make one folder. It's called the When I'm Gone folder. [music] Imagine you do everything perfectly and it causes trouble when you're gone. It's like you were so good at managing wealth that [music] after you leave it actually becomes a problem for your family because you did all the work. They should have all the details of everything. So when your family wants to access anything, [music] they can because a good passing away gift if I could say is this right? It is [music] peace of mind. Lots [music] of love from the 01 team and I'll tell you this year is going to be awesome.",

    "transcript_full": "sir H everything is sorted now what sorted so I have my own portfolio Okay penny stocks out of the house and also Diversified portfolio Okay but all of these are Indian stocks right of course so oh India is a growing country do you have any idea the amount of money that is coming inside the country India is the answer sir I'll invest here what phone do you have and what laptop do you use so I have Apple iPhone I use Windows laptop probably use a Chrome browser probably use Amazon to order all these companies are not based in India their companies abroad and they have different returns so the point is a lot of people make this mistake of only investing in their own country it's actually called a home bias in fact in 1991 there was a paper which talked about Investors that only looked at their own country to invest now I'm not saying don't invest in India India is a fantastic place to invest but if you're investing maybe in this episode we should explore what home bias is and should you have some exposure abroad but do you think there's some problem here correct basically I don't have enough money plus those companies are too big and plus they're already developed actually my friend said the same thing and you are saying you're probably thinking the same thing to all of this is not true so in this episode we'll bust all these myths let's start with myth number [Music] one [Music] okay so here um let's go back in time cuz we always go back in time to 1992 now check out this roller coaster of the market the sensex went from this 2,000 something points to 4500 points that is what to 74% oh if I would have invested 1 lakh rupes at that got it but after that the 4500 went to this number which is below 2500 imagine how would that make you feel just a second back I was calculating it went to Z so that's quite a roller coaster right and this is beyond your control you can't do anything because this is when the scam of harad MAA was happening in the market you can't do anything about it but you would have felt certain emotions so that's a crazy roller coaster isn't it I know but sir I have multiple roller coasters see I if if this happened I have fds to save my money I have Golds I have reads I mean that's what he taught me right in all these episodes which you should check out totally right which you you're saying is that you're Diversified so even if this happens there'll be some cushion interestingly I also thought exactly the same way until I went to turkey with Swati where I met someone interesting who was from Argentina now in Argentina these people get their salary and then as soon as they get their salary they run out and buy all the groceries they can all the clothes they can whatever they want that same day so that they don't have to spend anything the next day do you know why why put it in the comments if you can guess because they have hyperinflation I think last time I checked their inflation was this much which meant their value of that salary literally loses by the hour or by the day so they have to spend everything otherwise it's a financial loss to hold cash but that happened in Argentina do you think that's going to happen everywhere no but geopolitical risk is something you cannot predict my point is very simple uh hyperinflation has happened in many countries many times who knows what India will go through in the short term over the next 40 years or 50 years look at this chart over here you'll see Hungary Yugoslavia Zimbabwe went through hyperinflation now it's possible India never goes through that but why put yourself in that risk an Investor's job is to reduce risk and it's not only geopolitical it could be covid it could be social it could be any number of things that we don't have control on what we can do is try to diversify just a little bit more imagine at these times people would go with a wheelbarrow have cash on it walk down the street to a supermarket and buy groceries to buy one loaf of bread oh they're taking multiple Loaf in that no just one loaf because hyperinflation price is very high that's right correct got it but sir she did everything right This Is No Escape then no uh she did everything right she did diversify but it is all within her own country so I personally think at some point in your life maybe not now you should consider having some exposure to uh stocks abroad dude at the start you had created a bunch of problems why don't we go myth correct so I don't know about documentation I don't know how to invest I don't know how to analyze the companies in a developed country I I want to invest in a growing also said those companies and countries are tooo large so why invest only correct plus I don't have enough money dude I think you have a lot of information and there are a bunch of myths over here so let's break them and start with myth number one the first myth is that my country will generate the most returns course so you think India is the best correct and it is it's growing really fast and it is it's growing really well and the respect is improving yes it is so therefore it must be the best place to invest yes of course so I need to grow my money I'll obviously find out growing countries where I can invest my money wrong so over here check this out this is the last 10 years from 2010 to 2020 so it's a 10e period and in this 10-e period we can see uh the returns for all these countries so India is definitely in the top three with 9% cagr which is amazing but are you surprised to see that a developed country like us is actually not bad you would imagine that the US or Japan is large and therefore their growth is smaller right right right it may not be the case actually you'll see that the large companies become even larger think about the large companies in India 10 years ago they're larger in India also today right so there's no limit of getting large I think that's how compounding works you shouldn't think that there is a limit oh what does that even mean right could you even think that there'll be a company worth $1 trillion in the world apple apple is and India is almost 3 trillion something isn't that crazy three apples imagine if someone told you this a few years ago that you wouldn't believe it right correct another question over here is logically speaking India is what 3.8% of the world's market cap so is there a reason for you to put 100% of your money in equity in India should you have have 1 2 3% somewhere abroad as well I am also trying to understand this well but understand the bias you may not want to invest abroad that's fine but understand the bias that we have so it's easy for you to say maybe people like you can invest but I can't afford to buy a $200 $300 per share company I don't have enough money unless you give me okay cool so that brings us to myth number two only the ultra Rich can actually invest in these markets AB um so actually that's not true um there are a lot of wealthy Indians yes which are investing abroad correct one way for example is to use a mutual fund in India which gives exposure abroad so if I had to make a checklist out of this I would probably say one use an authorized platform which can actually do this second think about the amount that you want to invest don't use it as a bank account don't leave money there you transfer you buy the stocks and that's it third if you don't have enough time and context to research which most of us don't including me I don't have the the time to do the research think about getting into say some kind of an index fund or a mutual fund in India which is giving some exposure abroad that's one way to do it so you're not thinking and also I would say until you don't have a good Indian portfolio because my bias still exists that India is fantastic place to be I would say have your Equity position in India completely done and then maybe a few percentage points can be allocated abroad if you think this makes sense and if you do consider to invest abroad maybe us is the place to start with which brings me to my next myth and you had said this and I know you are also thinking this large developed economies make invest correct a mature economy has already found its 10x 100x winners so there are no opportunities correct a mature economy grows slowly so the stock market will be dull and boring correct a growing economy will have all these opportunities in fact India is where everyone's going to therefore a developed economy like us will have 2 or 3% returns and it's not worth her time this is not true let me show you some data yes so look at this the First Column here is year and so is this column this is the GDP growth rate of USA in India let's compare three numbers here 2% 6% minus 2.7% this is the GDP growth of us us and if I look at India it's 7 + 9 - 5.8 which is fine that was the co event but look at India growth rate it's phenomenally better than us Talia but let's look at the returns of us Dow Jones average and returns of nifty so look at this - 8 + 4 + 18 + 24 + 7 + 14 plus 22 + 12 oh America actually beat us in that particular year - 5 + 3 + 25 + 28 it's not that bad higher yes it's uh I mean of equal sort of it's not that bad I'm not saying us is better but I'm saying it's not that bad us stock market returns are surprising once you actually see it but remember this was Dow Jones Dow Jones has these old Transportation companies and all the new AG tech companies like say apple Netflix Nvidia Etc they're all in NASDAQ NASDAQ good job so you can see NASDAQ and I'll just read the returns from 2013 onwards 13.4% 5% 7% 28% minus 3+ 35 + 43+ 21- 33 it's sort of like the creme DEA Creme of tech which is growing serving the world in one index called the NASDAQ so does it feel like you should ignore it so I'll put all my money in NASDAQ right now no no wait wait hold up I'm not saying you should invest abroad don't do that all I'm saying is that this bias exists and you should know that there are opportunities outside of India as well so when you have some extra cash when you feel that your India portfolio is working well and you're stable emergency fund all that is good then you can think okay one more place to diversify is probably abroad sir opening a demat account in India is easy plug now you want me to open up abroad um I know it may sound like I have to go through a lot of documentation again I'm sure compliance I'm sure taxes I don't know how this works so you're totally right um opening an account abroad is not easy but it's become easier through the liberalized remittance scheme other than that there are some platforms which just make it easy for you to buy it online so just make sure you don't buy it from an app or a website which is fraudulent and fake like a lot of the Forex apps out there you should probably do an episode on that tell me if you want to put it in the comments so that's what you can do but there's one more Advantage what here's a quiz for you when was the last time you saw the rupe INR rate what was that rate I've seen 45 you old but the point is this going from 45 to 83 someone has profited right and why this happens is because India is a primarily an export driven economy we export textiles we export chemicals we export um IT services so this rupee will continue to depreciate it will keep going higher and higher if your money is in dollars you're actually benefiting from that rise do you think of that no so if NASDAQ didn't move at all you still profit somewhat from that appreciation of the dollar oh interesting right so that's also an interesting thing over here so the dollar is going to continue to appreciate at least as far as we know so far perfect I got it so I would agree on one thing I definitely had home buyas okay to be honest yeah but yes I would consider uh investing abroad maybe sometime later just not right now that's fair what do you think did you have home bias as well did you learn anything new it's really important for us to understand whether the psychology series we're running is actually helping you and abish or not please write something large long in the comments and tell us whether we did good or bad and don't forget to subscribe other his K is you know subscribe incentive nice thank you so much see you in the next [Laughter] episode okay let's find out okay",

    "title_current": "How Luxury Brands Keep You Poor",
    "transcript_full": "this bag costs 3 lakh rupees but this person actually buying it earns 3 lakh rupees a year so we looked at 10 such Brands to find three dirty little secrets that they use to brainwash look at this bag tell me how much does it cost 3,000 rupees 30,000 30 lakh rupees it's actually 300 rupees the cost of this bag is basically your raw materials labor cost and other overheads the cost isn't that much but people's perception of it when you actually go to buy it could be LAX and I'm not making this up Dior actually has a 4,800 markup on their products and Armani buys their bags for around 90 and sells it for €1,800 why is there such a big difference between the manufacturing cost and their selling cost at some point of course the product quality is good and it might make you feel really special but most of this markup is the feeling that you've got something you can't get anywhere else it's for the Lo and the insane part about all of this is that sometimes these Brands don't even make a product which has utility like a garbage bag from Balenciaga which is something you're supposed to wear and I'm not saying that any luxury product is not utilitarian so you can look at these Brands over here they all have different prices this is really expensive but they all do the same thing tell time my point is simple as something gets more expensive the product features get better the quality gets better but at a certain point this stops and the only way price can go up are not features or better quality but the product perception in other words the brand actually let's just call it the logo if there's no difference in utility and the price keeps going up why the hell are people buying this stuff in no circumstance when the price goes up demand also goes up but for luxury items this is exactly what happens and this is called the weblin effect if you think about what motivates people to live this Human Society people first want to survive they actually want connection but right up this hierarchy is this interesting thing called status if you get something you are respected by everyone around you this is why the weblin effect actually works if you purchase something which makes your friend go wo you'll actually pay a premium for it and the luxury companies know this and they understand you and this is precisely how they brainwash you in 2008 when all businesses were going a total the one thing a company should do is make its prices more affordable right but not not luxury Brands lvmh actually increased its prices by 12% and the profits and revenue actually grew it's almost as if they understand the psychology so well and that pricing depends on perception and that discounts is something lvmh or any luxury brand will never do and it's not just lvmh you can look at the Hermes bags they are super expensive some of them are really tiny some of them are mediumsized but people are actually paying more every sing single year in fact the resale price of different Burkin bags is much higher than the showroom price so this is the first Dirty Little Secret The weblin effect but how does a good even become a weblin good and to understand this we'll have to understand dirty little secret number two what if money can't buy if you really want something what what female watches do you have in stock what luxury brands do is that they create limited Supply and don't allow you to buy it today I only have exhibition but made for sale today what thats again I don't have any watches out all for selling everything is exhibition they just simply don't give you access everything in the showroom is just for exhibition I guess the only way to buy it if you get invited and this is true for handbags as well and another technique is called clustering if you look at say BMW and Audi they will segment the audience into various parts and have a more affordable car and a super expensive car but a luxury brand like say bugatti won't do this they will only sell something super expensive and nothing in between and they form this cluster over here where a single car can cost millions of dollars and because that brand can't be bought for a lot less people actually pay that amount the recipe for exclusivity are these three things make it really difficult for someone to buy something Target everyone so Society sees it as a status symbol and never ever give discounts and this brings us to the luxury Paradox think about it a corporation wants to earn more profit every single year and the simple way to do that is by selling more product at a higher price but a luxury maker can't actually do that he has to sell the illusion of exclusivity saying I can't give you this you have to be worthy of my product yet it has to maximize profit and if it's done really right cuz it's not as simple as I say this you can actually create creat some of the most richest companies in the world and some of the richest Founders in the world to sustain this luxury Paradox it's part of their business to make sure the supply is always less for example this company Richmond actually destroyed its own watch collection because it wasn't sold worth millions of dollars it even went to its Retail Partners and bought back the watches that were not sold Burberry did the exact same thing well berbery is going to very extreme lengths has destroyed $37 Million worth so the second secret is money can't buy these Goods but to understand how this is even created all of this illusion you need to understand the Third Secret and it starts with a really interesting social experiment we built a fake luxury store in Los Angeles and filled it with Payless Shoes maybe this is my next business model they're elegant sophisticated I just think it's so classy and I can tell it was made with high quality material these fashionist has actually paid 200$ 400 and even $600 for pay last shoes so wait a minute people paid $600 for Payless shoes that usually cost $19.99 why would someone pay 30 times more for the exact same product the brain does something interesting it makes a shortcut to understand what a brand stands for in seconds like the pesi example here are a few things that made it look like a luxury brand like the name sounds Italian the lighting looks exclusive the people shopping there look expensive even the way that this statue looks oh my God this place does not look cheap and of course if you have a look at the pricing you know it's expensive even the sales people don't look like normal salesmen it looks like they're doing you a favor by talking to you for buying their own own product brand perception may be more important than quality and we have a research paper to actually back this up this was done for Zara products and it basically said for purchase intention only 13.3% is product quality the rest you guessed it is brand image so if I had to create my own luxury brand this is the formula I would use perception is everything so luxury brands are basically selling you status but status has changed Through Time soldiers of Sparta Bishops of Rome and Poets of wear you could never buy to get this position in society you actually had to do a bunch of things to become that valuable but now luxury Brands can give an opportunity to actually buy the status if you do the right things and get that admiration from everyone but the interesting thing is despite us making this video all these people shines yeah I just got promoted it's a gift I saved for 2 years to get this 25th birthday I deserve it bu the amount of compliments I got crazy I mean it's the latest one now sexy they'll still buy the product",

    "transcript_full": "zero one has made 200 videos around money and you'd think everyone in the company understand how money works but i don't think so so instead of getting abhishek this time we got so we'll go through four rounds and see if they actually understand about it are you guys ready you have never fallen for a financial scam drink this shot if you've fallen for a scam that they think is not right and actually what's happened to them everyone drink a shot because you did not know that this scam exists here is the question because i know i am financially literate i would say they are also financially literate but not to the same level as i am yeah so they would use that money somewhere else to buy property to buy gold which i am not comfortable giving my money to the people i would love for you to have the shot but i think the answers are quite good despite you saying that i'm not sure so here's the next question so 30% of in hand invest kar right in hand invest kar right in hand invest kar pure donate kar what do you spend on the most i spend on food you know even india's net household savings are at a forty seven year low and that's a problem because lower savings mean a smaller financial cushion for you that's why you should save a little more let's move on to the next question you are amongst the richest 10% people in india if you are the richest 10% you will be top 10% so statistically if you're earning 25,000 rupees a month you are actually top 10% earner of india it's my caveat if you're in india you're undeclied income and income tax is not so base is not a big deal of people not reporting how much they're earning that even 25,000 rupees comes to a 10% it may actually not but if you use things like netflix cred or zerodha you still are among the top 10% in india so you actually are doing financially well aren't you alright let's start round two and we've made the drinks worse if you were fired today and you didn't get a job anywhere would your savings last more than five months if they would not last one aapik karcha wai aap oh my god think of something expensive that you bought on an emi take a shot if you don't have the entire amount of cash in your account and you could not have bought it in cash you had to take a loan for it alright anish tell me what is it car car laptop phone camera i think you know it because you know lesson you guys know you should not have done this what was the last thing you purchased just because it was at heavy discount this means round two is over drink a shot if you overspent on a delivery app because it asked you that you please order more to get a discount super savor to check the random tea because the discounts on the face of it look a lot higher what do you think is actually happening dark patterns please explain dark patterns are hidden ways on how delivery apps charge you more and incentivize you to maybe make more order or a larger order so that they can deliver more and get more profits so most people think that they are actually getting a discount but they're not there are two things one there's one there's urgency so they will have meters etcetera to actually make you order fast and second they have is if you add this you'll get a discount because everyone loves a discount because it's a small order size alright next question who has more than a seven fifty's civil score he does not drink if you don't know your civil score please drink why don't you know cibil score i don't necessarily have any line of credit that i'm using actively i've never i've not even bought anything on emil so it's actually very interesting think of credit score not like i need a loan in the future think of it like people use it as character judgment also is this person reliable it's important to have some score over here and even if you take some credit you should at least know what your current civil score is okay next question drink a shot if you've ever felt jealous of someone's lifestyle and how much they earn drink drink pulkit how do you deal with it i hate it when i feel like someone has got something and he's put lesser effort there no matter how much gratitude i do i i feel the universe is not fair despite me knowing the universe doesn't care so this is the end of round three now let's move to round number four everyone follow anish very nice you've made pyramid everyone make pyramid we've already filled your glasses with even worse drinks how many people have corporate insurance here how many people have bought more insurance outside of this for their parents and themselves why don't you have health insurance for yourself how will you get healthy what do you what are the three things you need to do stop drinking smoking maybe better life what does that mean gym workout and absolutely good food mhmm balanced diet have enough protein you actually need to reverse your body markers back to what it was maybe i don't know seven years ago so you hopefully don't need insurance for a while mhmm and because having not having insurance is actually a really big risk who else doesn't have insurance here i am saving for emergency fund so if i go for insurance actually that's really good so i think you already know this but we should say it health insurance at a lower age will get you a better premium when it when you're older it can be it can even be double so all your waiting periods on diseases and all that go away so buying health insurance when you actually need it actually doesn't make sense financially you wanna buy it when you actually don't need it let's look at the next question who has term insurance term insurance term insurance term insurance life insurance alright please drink the reason you buy life insurance is to take care of people who are dependent on you and your loved ones so if you have a dependent you must have term insurance next question has anyone bought gold jewelry for investment purposes logically the problem is you have to store that gold in a locker that'll cost you anywhere between 5,000 to 15,000 a year so can you please add that to the cost of the gold then on your base cost of jewelry if it's jewelry you have to subtract 25% or x percent for the making charges so technically 50% of the value of your gold or a very large portion of the value of your gold was gone in these expenses and the actual gold is less do you buy it to wear do you buy it to wear it's not an investment i'm wearing it because i want to and it's fine now we'll talk about the most interesting

    "transcript_full": "So, here's the problem. Property prices are rising. You want to buy it at your salary. Everyone tells you why you can't buy it. This video is not going to be about why you can't buy it. It's going to be about how you can buy it. And if you can't, what you have to do to actually get there. So, here's what you need to do. You need to actually write all these chapters and your answers with me in the comments so all of us can actually learn from each other and figure out how you can actually own this home. Here's what happens in real estate. It is not even a scam. I scam is a small word for it. I used to cry you know that we are having money in our pocket and we are not able to purchase a flat of our own choice. The first thing you see is a newspaper ad saying almost all units are sold out. Let's suppose these are all the units and they say there only one or two left. So the people over here just put a token money and based on the token money they say that the house is sold but a token money is not actually selling. So to verify this we went to the RAR website and looked at ads where real estate developers said that all of the units are sold and found that the units aren't sold. They're just creating, you know, artificial scarcity. [Music] He's in jail. [Music] 9% scheme bank I mean builders our own colleague you know again retired person he paid 95% of the amount and he was living on he living on rent for 7 years after that you are paying housing loan bank installment and you are a retired person. Just imagine this is a study by Anorok saying lacks of homes were delayed up to 6 years. Now I want you to think that before you make your decision for this you have to factor in that if you're buying an under construction home there are chances probabilities that the project will be delayed and you just won't get your home. So this is the first thing you should be careful about. The system is such in India that it might take 60 65 months for you to get possession of a property in India. Sometimes it's not the builder it's just the system to blame. Yeah within 2 years 3 years 4 years why properties those three BHK same size same amenities same everything have become 6 crores from 1 and a2 crores what's gone up the way property rates have gone up especially in metros that we sitting in now the properties which were 6,000 7,000 rupees square ft today are touching 16 17,000 within a period of a year year and a half why what's happened such fast in such a small period of time. The banks are happy because they're giving loans. The government is happy because they're getting taxes out of it. So the whole industry is getting serviced with that. Right? End of the day, do you think the property today is worth it? What it is supposed to be? I say it's a completely inflated market. Here is your task. Your task is to go and ask your parents or your grandparents what was their earning and what was the cost of the house that they bought or the land that they bought. Basically take the cost of the home let's say it's 1 cr divided by their income yearly let's say 10 lakhs. So you'll get a ratio called 10x. This is the price to income ratio. So if you look at this and this chart over here shows the price to income ratio across Indian cities. Suppose you live in Gurugram. Buying a house in your own city has a ratio of just 2.77. That's affordable. But if you try to buy in Mumbai, the ratio jumps to 7.46. Also, if you see Mumbai to Delhi all the way to Kolkata, this is the EMI to income ratio. So if your income is 100, 116 someone is spending on just EMIs. That's crazy. And the lowest I can see over here is 41%. Even that's high. How can you spending 41% on your EMI? what will happen to emergencies and general expenses. But if you look at this, you'll see that EMI to income ratios range between 41% all the way to 116%. This means we're chasing a race and playing a game we just can't win. There's nobody going to come and talk about it altogether. Uh a lot of people ask you uh for black money. Well, all through their life want money in white. I have to pay something in black. Black money is interesting because both parties are incentivized and it's like a black hole. Someone who has black money wants to spend that black money where black money is accepted which is real estate in many many cases. So they want to actually use their undeclared income to buy a home. The seller also wants to do it because he doesn't get to pay tax. In both cases, the person who has black money is incentivized and so is the other party. And that's why it's a little tough to get rid of in NCR. I noticed it's an option. In tire two cities, it's a necessity. They always uh the registry cost is what they can save on right that comes when you are dealing in crows that counts to a big number now and if you are not ready to give it, it's a hurdle for you. Service class people like us, middle class people like us who has all through their life money in white have to pay something in black. So people who are earning a salary are actually paying an honesty premium because they're at a disadvantage because they are paying full taxes. They're paying extra money compared to people who are dishonest and didn't pay taxes. This is unfair and unfortunately I don't know what the solution to this is. Now apart from prices there's also something called the floor space index. It's by the government telling you how much you can actually construct. So an FSI of one means the same area of land you can have the same area of floor space. So the higher the FSI the taller the building. And obviously I have a chart over here to show this to you. You can see here that Singapore I can't even see what the number is but Tokyo is 20 but if you look at Tane it's one which is why you don't have a lot of skyscrapers there. So this begs the question, why doesn't the government just increase the FSI? So if we have taller buildings, we have more inventory, more houses, and therefore the prices will be lower. Right? That's what I thought until some people started debating that to have higher FSI, you need to have better infrastructure. So if you have more housing in say South Bombay, do you have enough roads, enough parking, enough facilities, enough sewage, enough water? All of that actually needs to make say make make sense and also the green space if too many people are living in an area is it even habitable how you can afford 50,000 rupees salary may an actual home so let's say you earn 50,000 rupees a month and you plan to buy a 50 lak rupee home you've saved 5 lakhs which by the way is less down payment should ideally be 20% and you take loan at 9% interest your EMI comes to about 40,000 rupees. That's 80% of the monthly salary. Clearly not affordable. So, we have a two-point checklist. Unless you see tick marks in these check boxes, you probably can't afford that house yet. So, if you earn 50,000 rupees a month, your EMI shouldn't cross 20,000 rupees and you should have at least 10 lak rupees in savings for making the down payment. Now if you add stamp duty, maintenance, taxes, furnishing and interest, the actual cost of that 50 lak rupee home rises to about 1.2 cr rupees over 20 years. That's the financial truth. Now the emotional truth. See uh if you buy a house all your finances will go into one thing only. I mean whatever savings you have everything will go there. And in case there are challenges if you won't be able to sell it at a short notice with other investments you can make it. So always divide your investments. Don't keep all your eggs into one basket. Diversify yourself. I have made three principles in life. Number one never buy under construction property. If I ever ever again venture into market and buy a property it will be a ready to move in property. Two make sure all papers are correct. So when you buy a move in property, it will be registry day one. It will not be a carry forward future is bright 3 years down the line subvention plan. And three, never ever go by the name of the builder or the background of the builder. The bigger the name, the more chances of them growing up with you. When I was a kid, owning a house was a dream. Now when I have a house, paying the whole AMI is my dream. Buying that home and entering is a great moment. But all the moments in your last 5 years if you write down that you remember were relationships with your friends, your parents, your family. You would also have trips you did, experiences you did, things you laughed on. Maybe you should curate those as well and not just a single asset that breaks your financial back. Akimazi.",

    "transcript_full": "this is a list of all the debts abhishek has so in this episode i'll cover a simple five step formula to help you and abhishek get out of debt quickly abhishek why do you have 1 lakh rupees credit card debt so arishek i bought the car no so i had to get that thing done what it's a paid arishek you know how much interest you'll pay on this now what i'll do is i'll pay minimum amount 3.5% interest makes it within two years i'll pay off the loan i'll be that big no dude listen listen now let's suppose you pay the minimum due for the next two years you'll pay about 86,000 so who get it free no you'll still have 60,000 rupees left this is the interest 60,000 more you could have covered another in that sir can you can you save my interest can you help me with some plan i can if you don't do that we can talk about this way called the avalanche method and the snowball method let me show this to you okay basically if you have credit card debt you are paying 42 45% on it what you need to do is convert that outstanding payment that 1 lakh rupees convert it into emi it will be charged like a loan okay so i have a excel sheet over here this is your personal loan your credit card one credit card two home loan car loan total amount payable over here this 36% because you convert it into an emi this will become say 16% and this 42% will become 18% so that itself has completely changed your interest so let me explain what's avalanche okay avalanche is basically this let's suppose you have multiple credit cards you have credit card one credit card two credit card three which one will you actually pay red's a red red's my favorite color that's why you'll pay red first yes this is why you make mistakes this is why you lose money you have to select a credit card where you're paying the most interest so if you're paying 15% on this 14% on this and 36% on this which one should you actually pay hello and then you pay the next then you pay your next this is called the avalanche method you start repaying the ones with the highest interest rate at the first and then you go down so that your interest is reduced okay so how much money can you actually pay towards debt every month eight minutes calculate it 44,000 and your total emi is 42,000 therefore you have this 1,793 rupees left this you will pay towards your existing credit card bills because you can afford this extra amount i'll save it no no no you said save money if you have extra money you will overpay your emi and that's because when you pay an emi some of that amount goes into paying the interest and the remaining balance gets subtracted from your principal so if you pay any extra amount above your emi that additional amount directly goes into paying the principal balance so basically on an excel sheet this is what it looks like so this is credit card two now notice we have 85,000 balance we have an emi of 7,793 we have interest of 1,273 principal paid is 6,500 which means if you pay this additional amount that extra amount goes towards paying the principal oh so that will quickly pay off my loan yeah and you guys can actually fill your details here to figure this out so now according to this sheet we have all your debt over here and if you do this extra payment every single month then you will save nice so this is one way to do it but actually avalanche is not the best way because the avalanche method has a problem it takes too long to get results and it feels like you're not making progress there is a thing called snowball method this is actually very simple so if you have two debts to pay which debt do you pick first to actually start paying first off yeah correct that's exactly what the snowball method is oh you pick the smallest loan quickly pay it off and move to the next that way your brain thinks i have made progress this week or this month and then the next month you feel a little more motivated there was even a harvard study on this where people prove that if they start paying even their first loan off and they take it out they feel more accomplished they feel better yeah so that's the snowball method it's pretty simple okay so let's move to point number two take good debt and avoid bad debt sir debt to debt good bad i feel me listen good debt and bad debt are different so if you're taking debt to fulfill your needs that is good debt like an education loan but if you're buying something for your wants or your greed or just to show off that's a bad debt to understand this let's play percent per annum interest is it a good debt b bad debt bad debt are you sure yes sir long debt that's the correct answer you've crossed the fella padao this is bad debt because this is not a need question number two what situation makes a home loan bad debt a taking a home loan for a self occupied house at a reasonable emi b buying a second house assuming you'll be able to pay the emi with the rent c taking a twenty five year home loan with a 20% down payment or d taking a floating rate home loan when interest rates are expected to fall so i would like to go with option number b should i lock it yes are you sure 100 percent absolutely right very nice next question on your screen question number three priya takes an education loan of 15 lakh rupees to fund her higher education in india with a 9% interest rate is it good debt or bad debt sir i think that's a good debt because she'll get good education eventually leading to a higher salary i think it's a good debt are you sure yes lock we lock and you have won very nice next question question number four vikram takes a 5 lakh rupee gold loan at 11% interest rate to invest in the stock market is it a good debt or b bad debt 5% what gold invested okay bad debt so we lock this i think so where have you learned finance zero one by zero very nice congratulations this is the right answer good job equity is the most risky asset out there anyone saying 10% those are assumptions good job and loan question number five which of the following is an example of bad debt is it a taking a business loan at 10% interest to expand the profitable restaurant b take a 3 lakh rupee personal loan at 14% interest for a vacation in europe c having emis of 10,000 with a salary of 60,000 or d taking a home loan at 7.5% interest for a house in a developing area that's a difficult question i think taking a loan for your vacation sounds like a bad debt are you sure vacation is always good imagine the reels yes sir you will lose all your money if this is not the right answer lock it you played very well but here you became a little overconfident it's a good choice and in this answer it's absolutely right at free yes yes okay now that you understand the difference between good loan and bad loans let's move on to the next point take one more loan it's called refinancing for example let's suppose you have an existing home loan and the home loan let's say is at 10% and the rbi reduces its repo rates which is basically the rate it gives loans to banks now let's suppose you are on a fixed rate and your loan does not adjust so what you can do is you can take another loan and refinance that 10% to a 9% so you're paying lesser interest how much will i save sir so we have a loan refinancing excel sheet here over here you can see 9% interest of how much money you're paying and the loan amount is here the €10 here the email is here you can change all of this you'll find a link in the description now let's suppose this 9% changes to 8% okay so i'll change this to eight as soon as i change it look at this money saved column 5 lakhs another way to think of this is debt consolidation a friend of mine vandit is exactly in this okay okay so he has multiple loans all different amounts he knows that this is roughly he's paying about 25% interest on them because most of it is credit card so what i would do is i would take a personal loan uh-huh in this case because the interest here is high and this would be what between 11 to 15% depending on your civil and profile how will i get this loan when i have too many loans that's a good question but if your sybil score is bad you won't get this because you're not paying here but assuming your sybil score is good okay and your your prepayment history is good then you get this you pay all of this in one shot you have to manage one emi over all lower interest rate of this personal loan which is thirteen fourteen 15% but please make sure you do the calculation on your excel sheet whether this actually applies to you or not so now that we're done with this let's move on to the next point tell me all your expenses i'll write it rent yeah 7,000 okay groceries roughly 5,000 alright travel bagheran $12,000 i travel a lot okay and what about bakki bills you know you drink your coke and all the other stuff hang out yeah $3.02 4,000 dish alright anything else which is 43,000 what 43,000 okay so this total is 60,000 your salary is 70,000 what's the where's the rest tell me quickly quickly quick quick exactly my point i knew this guy has no idea where his money is going because he's abhishek you have to make a budget you have to know where all your money is going and even after the budget you should log in all of your expenses why because what is measured can be controlled and if it's not measured it cannot be controlled controlled and if you want a budget excel sheet you want uh-huh you want you comment i want budget excel sheet and we'll find a way to send it to you yeah i'll do it and this brings us to point number five which is your biggest loan home loan credit card can i save money yes you can and you can too so i have an excel sheet over here this is loan repayment all you have to do is look at this amount over here what's the interest rate 9% what's the loan amount 25 lakhs and the ten year 300 so this is about twenty five years okay you can change these numbers obviously and the emi is 2000980 does that sound affordable it does not much right uh-huh but let's look a little closer how much interest are you paying 37 lakhs yeah above 25 lakhs exactly so you're paying 25 plus 38 lakhs on this now a large portion of the emi that you're paying out of this 20,000 a very large portion is the interest so look at this so over here we can see what's the home loan balance in month one 25 lakhs and then home loan emi is $20,009.80 the interest is 8 18,000 so out of 21,000 roughly 18,750 is going to the interest part and only 2,000 is going towards the 25 lakhs that's a very weird strategy so if you look at this that's why the red is so high and the blue is so low because they're charging the interest first yes after two hundred months is when you start paying more principle in principle than interest how can you fix this correct correct correct see your emi is fixed every year you are increasing your salary if not every year every second year you are increasing your salary every year every year every second year you are increasing salary every year you increase yes so as that happens can you do a step up in your emi let's say 5% more every year i'll put 5% over here so that thirty seven thirty eight lakhs has now become 20.59 lakhs oh i have saved a lot of money yeah remember this is over long periods of time so you will not feel it in the first few years but of course in the tenth year twentieth year that 5% will have also come back i'll save money yeah you'll save money another way to think about this if you do a 10% step up that twenty five year alone ends in just ten years oh now if you've not taken a loan you must plan for this because why do you want to pay an extra 15 lakhs or whatever the difference is over here if you can avoid it but here's the real question personal finance is personal what you feel what you can do what you cannot do what your fears are what your hopes are what your debt is we would love to hear really long paragraphs of your stories of how you are handling your debt your credit card your home loan your car loan and we can learn from each other in the comment section",

    "transcript_full": "study hard find a job take a loan buy a home dress to impress this is terrible advice this is a never-ending Loop and you want to come out of this trap right so you need to write your own rules you know when your salary hits your account and then it vanishes well for most people that's exactly how it happens because salary isn't something to save and grow it's something to spend and that's exactly the problem you're treating your salary like this endless waterfall of money coming into your account every single month and then you spend it and then you earn it and that itself is the endless loop so here's what you've got to do sit down alone write down all your expenses every single little bit you know that Center fresh you know that party you did you know when you went out with your friend you know that little aloia you every single expense now that you have all of these expenses laid out cut out the extras I know you know what I'm talking about you know that expense that you could have avoided G you have food why are you ordering from outside I'm not saying change your life but cut out the extras and then do the most dramatic best thing you've ever done for yourself reduce your expenses by 1% and what you deduct from your expense will basically go into your savings it's pretty simple if you think about it so imagine your expenses are what 50,000 Rupees a month and 1% of that would be 500 rupees so basically I'm asking you to Skip One online food order it's not that difficult that 500 Rupees is invested let's say in some form of index fund that makes a 10 to 12% cagr that's over a period of time that money will actually start growing now I know you might think that's not a lot of cash but that's not the point the point is The Habit to begin is more important than the money itself but I'll talk about that a little later focus on the expense tracker so that you can make this first step you think you're funny do you but you know all this money you can make from index funds and all is probably a lie no one told you this I'll be the first one to tell you investing is not as important as creating your own emergency fund you see all these people in office working buying a car all of that they don't have any savings which means that if they lose their job they won't last one month and no one really said this we talk about sips and people investing and then making money but dude the first step you can do for yourself is not investing is creating savings so that you can last at least 6 months without your job think about the real chains around you it's the salary the money is supposed to give you freedom but you can't leave it because you don't have money you realize what I'm saying it's simple first find out what's your monthly expense let's say it's 30,000 rupees 30,000 multiplied by 6 months 6 3 are 18 1.8 lakhs this number should be in cash in your account not easily accessible this is your new superpower it will reduce your fear because you have 6 months of backup your work will actually get better but there's one more problem that bad month could also be a health emergency this is the chart of it's not Nifty it's Health expenses it's becoming really expensive to get sick in our country so you must have health insurance most people don't become poor because they made less money they become poor because one single event put them back 5 years think about it you'll your productive years are from 20 all the way to 60 and if you lose five years that's like almost 10% of your life so basically you need to make sure you have an emergency fund and a health [Music] insurance to make sure that you're actually safe hey what are you doing I'm shooting yeah following the crowd following the Crowd Oh actually that makes [Music] sense why do we buy things even if we can't afford it it's not your fault at all it's actually hardwired inside you think about it when we went from Hunters to gatherers we had to survive in a tribe and tribal acceptance was really important it's how we survived so the top guys in a tribe actually got the most resources but how do you define who's on top the person with the most strength the person who had great amount of resources or special tools or alliances was the alpha but now things are very different you do social signaling with stuff with the iPhone with the car with the house you tell the tribe hey you should continue to be my friend because well I have all these things so marketers are actually hacking into your hard wirring without you even knowing it and you are actually following the crowd you're buying all the stuff you don't really need and the access to credit is so simple that you just have a lot of debt so a simple way to get out of this is called the debt to income ratio I have a calculator for you this is the world's simplest calculator but I promise you it'll change your life open up the calculator its job is to tell you how many days are you actually working for that credit that you have taken so you enter your income you enter all of the emis you're paying every single one of it and the calculator will do the rest it will tell you what percentage of your income is going towards emis remember when you're paying an Emi you don't own what you've bought the bank or the credit card company owns it you don't owe it yet it also owns another precious asset which is your time all that hard work you're putting on that project at work you're actually earning for someone else and not yourself anyway the debt to income ratio I read at a bunch of places and everyone said it should be below 36% if it's above 36% you're in the danger zone if it's below 36% you're in the safe Zone but you know what I think I think this number 36% was chosen because it sounds really smart it sounds oneir of your income and 36 sounds like a scientific number the truth is no one really knows how much debt is too much debt and I personally think you it shouldn't be more than 20% why do you want to buy stuff more than 1/5th of your salary but it's different for everyone and you can choose what this number is if you're scared to use this calculator I think even before you input the numbers you know that you probably have a little too much Emi and this is the most important Point actually come closer enough what you need to do is actually really simple and you already know it the magic is in actually doing it 1 2 3 the moment you take the first step you changed your life in an instant",

    "transcript_full": "Why do you use a credit card? I find it super fancy. To increase CIBILscore. Cashback. I like the metallic feel of this card. discounts. Lounge access Gen Z loves credit cards and why shouldn't they? You get EMI access, you get BREAD points. You also get access to all those nice deals and of course, free food and airport lounge. But in true de-influencing style, we're going to fact-check all of these claims because these guys don't. Before we begin, hit that like in subscribe and let's get started. Here's the credit card industry and it's been growing at 20% for 5 years. I mean 78 million cards. How much are they spending? Overall credit card spending has reached Rs.1.13lakh crore. And the industry is on such a roll that even COVID and RBI couldn't stop it. Look at that chart. And why wouldn't you see this growth? Credit cards have grown for a reason. It's not by luck. I mean two things. First. Now, freelancers, small businesses can actually get a credit card. So we have new customer segments who can actually access this kind of credit. Previously, it just wasn't possible. And second, are all the loyalties and benefits from that card. I mean, free movie tickets, online shopping, cash discounts, even stuff like travel has benefits for credit cards. All of this has caused that entire industry to grow and people to live well, sometimes beyond their means The credit card product has been designed for a certain kind of person. So a tier one person earning a salary for a long period of time, decent salary as such credit score is good and then the credit card is given. But somehow, now things have changed. It can now be offered to self-employed tuition teacher or a freelancer may also get a credit card. So the audience is now much wider. And here is my problem. The person who doesn't understand this, say a tier-3 town, for example, how minimum payments work, how interest rates work, how EMI is work, the yearly membership. This person may not even understand how much he has to pay in order to actually clear their account and how credit score works. Is it right for them to even have a credit card for example, my cousin brother, He went out with his friends and one drunken night he would do ₹200 cash from his credit card. I knew this was wrong, but he didn't know that he had to pay ₹500 on that one withdrawal, not to mention the crazy interest rate charged on that withdrawal He just had no idea about this. and hear I'm talking about someone who has some financial literacy. This guy invests in index funds, which is great, by the way. But think about the person who has no financial literacy. He got a call one day. Do you want a credit card? Found out the benefits, said this is cool Let me just order it. That's kind of dangerous. so to understand how this generation is spending on credit cards, what their usage is. We asked a bunch of people at the office. So Vandit What do you do with your credit card? Where do you buy? okay, so I recently bought this iPhone. I love sneakers, so I bought this sneakers limited edition, and I have this watch. Also, I got a 4K TV recently, so. Okay. What's your EMI Every month? It's. It's around 30,000. 30,000? Yeah And what if I let you go? What if you get fired right now? How do you make these payments for the next three months, I was told that this is a friendly interview. No, no, the point is, it's not happening. But if it did, you would miss your payment, right? Yeah. Then how do you make that payment? Like do you have savings. Do you know, dude, that these guys charge up to 48% a year in interest? Do you know that? It wasn't in the ad. exactly my point. So this means you have late payment fees, you have annual charges. You're also paying maybe three and a half percent a month. This will make your life hell. So Abhishek How do you use your credit card? sir I was not supposed to buy it. See, I have had a very bad experience. Multiple phone calls, take this card, that card I was like, okay fine, so I got two cards. So what are the EMI like? Like, how much did you pay last month? So I paid 2500, Yeah. Little less. Minimum amount is what you are asking? You paid the minimum amount right? Ya This is the problem. So if your entire bill was 50,000 and the amount due and you paid minimum 2000, for example, or 5000, the interest is still charged on the entire 50,000. They don't minus what you paid. Do you know that? So you continue to pay interest on that. There's no point in paying a minimum amount. You pay everything that is due Hey Shivani. Hi So how do you use a credit card? So basically I got my first credit card when I opened my salary account. Nice and then my limit was 50,000. okay. And did you use that credit card? Did you spend. yes, I did. But the maximum, which I used was 70,000. but you said your limit is 50,000. Yeah. So I increased it to 3.1 lakhs, but my spending limit was 70,000. Oh interesting. So you have credit worth three lacs, but you will spend only a maximum of 70,000 Yes, that's actually pretty good. It actually helps in something called credit card utilization. And the lower it is, the better. all right. actually, my friend asked me to do that. Good. Nice friend. So basically what is the ideal ratio? So anything below 30% is considered good. If you go above 30%, bad things can happen. so your credit card score will go down. And if you go for a home loan or a car loan or any kind of loan, you'll be charged a much higher interest rate because your credit card score is actually low. I'm done here. Thanks Shivani All right, Okay. So after talking to everyone, here's what I figured and made a checklist. If your answer for each of these things is yes, then you get that. credit card Otherwise, maybe not. One. I have a monthly budget plan. Two. I track all of my expenses every single month. Three. If I decide to quit my job, I have enough cash in the bank to last me a while. But here's my take on it. problem is not with the credit card. It's with humans. People cannot manage and be disciplined at the same time. We are just bad at managing stuff, especially when you get a golden ticket to spend more than what you have. You get into crisis like the debt crisis in the U.S.. Think about how many people over there have so much debt and no way to pay it. India, on the other hand, is far better in its savings culture. In fact, we should probably have an investment culture and not an overspending credit card culture. Again, the problem isn't with the credit card. It's with humans. We're just bad. Can't even do 75 days hard, how will we manage this? So the answer is pretty clear. If you are disciplined, a credit card is great. Otherwise, there are other things to spend time on. And if you still want to go for that credit card, tell me in the comments which credit card you already have or want to get, because I think this world is pretty crazy and I'll probably learn from you which credit card does what.

    "transcript_full": "hey dude dude why did you pick that one because you have to buy it now no dude this is expensive this much cheaper do that i'll i'll i'll i'll see you buy that dude this is exactly what you don't know right this is how these people treat you supermarkets place all the expensive stuff here so then you pick it up and you put it here and they earn more but the bargains are here it makes you spend more even cheaper ones even the size of this trolley we don't need so much stuff the music makes you spend more and the bar lot of travel is in the end so you have to go and pick it up if there are so many traps you couldn't have just ordered it via some application probably dude you think these apps apps don't have psychological tricks to make you spend more they're having delivery bro exactly actually we should do an episode on this oh so in this episode we thought why don't we look at the psychological tricks apps play to actually make you spend more on the internet on stuff like grocery and this guy has no idea how this works so why don't we help abhishek out let's begin when you got up in the morning what is the first app you used i was making breakfast music app yeah okay and you have a premium membership yes you pay me not of this one not of this app i have another app but i'll i'm planning to buy this one it's easy to use why are you planning to switch easy to use good album good songs and the ui looks nice yes but then you'll have two memberships what will you do with the first one i'll save money i'll cancel it oh good luck cancelling it good luck yeah dude it's really hard to cancel that app's subscription service what are you talking about i'll just do it right yeah open up settings yeah and click on plans mhmm now under plans go to this option here and then you'll find this tab click on that this is new browser yeah no yeah correct so now a new browser has opened outside of the app environment now here again let's find your plans yeah this one this will take some time this youtube video is only thirty minutes long so basically it's really tough to cancel that subscription and this is called fancy name roach motel and it's a fancy term fancy term for saying easy to get in really hard to cancel the subscription was easy to pay right correct it is probably auto debit yeah credit card very nice credit card that's we have a different video for that but you see most people won't make so much of effort to cancel like a 90 rupees membership they'll say yeah chhora you have to cancel it next month that's the point that's how this works and this is how they make money and you end up spending more why it's difficult to get out i mean think about it it's pretty obvious right they're basically exploiting human behavior and on an app their job is to one convert subscriptions which is why you have freemium right right so freemium songs to know a little bit of ads a little bit of irritation youtube also has this then you pay to make the experience better same way they are also creating dark patterns that's what it's called another fancy term to make it tough for you to cancel okay so these apps are horrible no no dude nothing's wrong with the apps it's just human behavior so i remember going to this really nice store to buy shoes okay a physical store and over there they showed me a bunch of a bunch of shoes and i like two shoes and the guy selling me the shoe knew this okay the shoe that i liked more he said sir let me see if i have a piece available so now i felt oh okay i can't take this i need a fresh piece and he went and came back after ten minutes and said sorry there is no piece available why don't you take the other shoe and he knew i didn't like the other shoe that much because i was telling him hey this is nice it feels good but you bought it i said please do something he said sir you'll have to wait ten more minutes he went in and he found he said sir your last this is the last piece it was expensive i bought it now i don't know if he had more shoes in the back but i feel online this becomes frictionless they say one stock available and you just go ahead and buy it it's always been there oh you know what's worse when they create scarcity by saying lightning deal have you faced this yeah three r mein khatam mo ra hai probably thirty minutes last night dude what does that mean what is three r mein khatam mo ra hai they're just creating an urgency for many people to buy that's why three r's there is a study where printers were sold more because they showed how much was left in stock printers were sold more yeah online people saw the number of printers available and the sales went up because there was less left and there was a proper study on this scarcity you just want stuff which is less available so tell me again why are you shifting to this new music app when you already have another premium music app okay so it's very simple i have a list of songs that i want to listen while working out okay and i was not able to find a few songs in that app the previous one but the new one hasn't but it's exactly so you know it helps me lift more weight in the gym beast mode super beast mode after dinner i go out for a walk now i like that chili again i had the same reason so i have this specific set of songs and how much did you pay for this app three months free premium customer it's a free trial it's a free trial three months and they have your credit card obviously you get the free trial and you can get i can cancel it anytime so one minute you paid nothing because it's a free trial for three months got access to all the songs created a routine out of it now it's a habit you're stuck what if i put a few ads in between while you're working out in beast mode and in your chilli walk no i'll just i'll just buy something that reduces those ads now the thing is you're enjoying this premium quality service without any ads for three months and it's part of your routine right it's really tough to go back to ads because i mean you can't so this is a great psychological hack to just get people in make it part of their routine so they don't get out hey arson now you're saying free trials are bad well i think you can't be right all the time now you said this is bad you said that is bad you said this is good you said that is good now you're saying free trials are bad no no dude free trials are fine they're actually a good thing you get free access to something you can cancel it the problem is the psychological trick behind it you'll also see this in cars if you go and buy some mid level high end car and say i want a trial the test drive which is also a trial they will give you the best model they have the top model the top model the most expensive one the one with the sunroof the one with the best speakers you'll go for the test drive now you won't go for the bass right because you'll go for mid or higher than that because when you go to the bass it'll feel naked it'll feel like you guys me kuch hai so bringing you up to a point and then trying to sell you something over there that may be wrong because you need to buy what you need not where you feel like a sense of emptiness ki i need this also because i was just going through this app this dating app okay wait wait tell me how dating apps work i don't know how they work you install an app got it you create a profile okay put good pictures then you swipe through other profiles okay and when it's a match like the other person so both of them have to like it yeah correct and then you start talking oh interesting so what's the hack over here so in the initial few days you'll get to see a lot of likes so you'll feel like there's a lot of interest from other people on you but you'll not be able to find those profiles why because you have to buy the premium one so you'll get like a blurred photo exactly yes yes and then that will instigate you to buy the premium subscription oh because curiosity and you really want to know who likes you exactly and now since you have bought the premium subscription now what happens is the likes the number of likes reduces day by day oh i have no idea why is that happening and where were those likes which were initially happened so there's an so hold up there's an initial dopamine hit correct because you come and you know all these people have liked you you're interested to make friends but you don't know who they are because their face is blurred yes then you buy a subscription you know who they are but the likes aren't enough so once the likes have gone down your dopamine's gone down how do i get back to the new high there are new plans oh upgrade add on perks some add on benefits some perks you pay more money exactly and you get more super likes some spotlight feature i don't know multiple features and you i'm sure you've paid don't tell anyone and i'm sure there's a fancy term for this of course there is it's this word that i can't pronounce effect so this effect basically says if there are a lot of open threads or unfinished tasks you want to go back and finish those tasks now imagine this on your apps with that notification icon so you have all these small nudges nudges you have something left in your basket please check it out you have only one item left something that you added to your wish list please buy it so all these notifications you get from all these apps nudge you to actually what what's the last notification you oh it's a delivery app girlfriend chocolate what's so funny i think it's designed to trigger people like you so that you order you know from this quick commerce website the piece of chocolate so i guess do you also get these weird matches i'd love to know the thing about these psychological tricks is the thing about these psychological the thing yes sir i'm listening i'm just ordering chocolates you want something why are you ordering right now it says $1.99 free delivery i mean orders above $1.99 free delivery yes $1.99 q for free yes no let me show you see when you order this it'll show free delivery there is handling fee there is some packaging you are really paying for the delivery and the dark pattern here is this you're thinking you're saving money by actually ordering this online but you're really not it's not the same you forgot something check this what what is this coupons this will save my bank balance yeah i'll just click on apply you read what's over there it says 20% off up to rupees 50 but that's not the case if it's a 2,000 rupee order it won't be 2,000 times twenty percent 400 rupees it will be up to 50 rupees so you'll just get $50 off oh i just click on apply exactly and i clicked the payment so coupons are great but you should know what's happening most people do that all of us think the entire game is about coupons and free delivery it's actually not it has nothing to do with the coupons it has everything to do with you racking up that basket they will not offer free delivery on $20.30 rupees they'll offer it on a few 100 rupees which means they're trying to make you habitual to add a bunch of things when whenever you order from the app so the entire game is how much do you add to the cart maximize that over a really long period of time you would have end up spending tens of thousands of rupees on that app they are trying to actually figure out lifetime value of you the customer and all these small little things is trying to push you in that direction and you'll end up buying more so do you think apps are gonna stop doing this i don't think so correct are you gonna stop shopping no exactly everyone's doing their job you need stuff that's why you need to shop you need convenience and they need to sell stuff there's nothing wrong here what's the checklist the checklist is for you to be a little more mindful of your spending and that will make all the difference and i have it here the first one is create a list why do you wanna go to an app and then decide what to buy like we used to do in supermarkets right so now you decide what you need from the store and then go in add it to the cart and you're out the second thing is set a budget if you know you can spend x and you can't go outside of it it'll really help next probably you shouldn't rush your decision if you get a notification of a lightning deal or something that requires impulse purchase probably don't do it another thing is using your reminders and calendar carefully when you do pretrial like he does so you can cancel it one or two days before the money is cut and if you really need it then of course take the service you put up a reminder you put up a reminder and the last one is turn off the notifications if you can because no one can nudge you but don't forget to turn on notifications for our channel press this icon this this also visit the website we have a fest coming up on april 28 you should definitely apply get the passes and come to the fest we've done a bunch of other episodes around psychology check them out goodbye goodbye yes bro i'm not used dating yet bro come on yes bro and i'm sure there's a fancy term for this the thing about this like the thing about it",

    "transcript_full": "we as the 01 community on what the next topic should be and they said this honestly I would have never picked a topic on teaching money with your partner that makes no sense but I thought we'll do it anyway right AEK sir it doesn't make sense I mean talking about money with my partner it's personal finance I'll teach it to her no dude that's not how it works I've been married for 8 years now and you might be thinking everything we learn about money is in context of of myself me me me in what's the difference the difference is now all your decisions are taken in context with your partner and your parents which are also aging and the truth is guys no one teaches us to become adults one day we just become adults and we're expected to know how the world works and that sucks I've been married for 8 years and somehow I figured it out with my friends so we thought why not talk about something no one does how to think about money in context of your family and your partner so you can lead a peaceful life does that make sense will that be helpful let's find [Music] out first sir I I'll okay getting married to a Rich Partner this is what you're saying no uh getting married to getting married to someone who is earnings so that expenses no rent no dude look this is about financial compatibility psychology is about biases psychology is about biases so if you know that your mind has a certain bias it's an easy way to overcome it now I'm not saying you'll be able to overcome all of it but let's talk about a bunch of biases and it'll tell you how you can overcome it the first one is spender versus sa is there a checklist there is no checklist this is marriage it's longterm it's about love but you don't want something else to come in between your love you know what that is uh money it's actually not money it's something else you'll find at the end of the episode let's start so what are you buying this month uh okay Jordans sneakers sneakers uh parties then a new pair of jeans oh I love the jacket okay I'll get this yeah yeah yeah okay okay these are these four items and how much are you saving this month after I spend I'll decide you're not sure how much so clearly if I have to bucket you within a saver or a spender I'll put you as a spender yes that's how you live life you don't save and you don't care about the future because of course you'll get the appraisal what is this what is this you only live once YOLO yes chill okay so I'm not saying you should change yourself let's assume for this discussion that you will be like this forever and you'll always be a spender it it also puts your future at risk in case something wrong happens but let's not get into that let's say your partner is also a spender right and you both love buying stuff and she buys the exact same things that you bought the sneakers the partying the going out the travel that jacket you like Etc and the watch neither of you will be able to save anything but we are living today no we are enjoying today to have problems tomorrow having a couple where both of them spend and nothing is saved is an issue imagine if your parents are also involved you have to take care of them if you have a kid School sweating a little bit sweating a little AC so I think you have two options here one is if your partner is just the opposite of you that she's a sa and you're a spender or the opposite you're the sa and she's a spender that works out really well sir I have a question imagine two person A and B yeah a is spender B is saver or B is also a spender both are Spenders correct but they are in love with each other should they break up is that is that what you're saying so spender or spender no this is not a love show this is a financial compatibility I'm giving you a situation sir the solution is very simple if you have two Spenders who are staying together who are Partners The Simple Solution is a habit you create a habit where as soon as you get your salaries a portion of it is transferred to a savings account or an FD or an investment so you can't touch it and then and this simple habit will fix it now I know this sounds simple remember if together you're not happy because of money that sucks and you don't want that in your life the problem is most couples don't have the money conversation exactly and because of that they don't know their personality type and once you know you're a saor or a spender then we've already discussed the solution you do that happier life people discuss if they are a spender or a saver I don't think they discuss anyway on to point number two sir I have a question to you with your 8 years marriage experience what has changed before marriage and after comparison can you just throw some light on that part this is a little deep question so let's let's see I guess when you're younger or probably as you're watching this you're expected to earn something right um and the head of the family are your mother and your father right and uh they look up to you but when you get married something changes you're no longer looking up to two more people suddenly you have your your spouse's parents also looking up to you yeah but as time goes by you are suddenly the figurative head of both families and you're also expected to start your own family so you have now three entities if I can say your parents your spouse's parents and your child looking up to you thinking that you have life figured out but the truth about being an adult is we're just kids who've grown a little older and we really don't know how life really works and everyone expects us to know the answers to everything the truth is we still need videos like this to sort of tell us that things have changed so I think the biggest thing that changed is you're supposed to now take care of your family you're supposed to take care of your spouse as she is supposed to take care of you you're also supposed to take care of both parents it's a responsibility it's and responsibility means their future their current security their St standard of living and their Joy which also includes time which you don't have when you're in your late 20s and 30s because you also have to look after your career so we need to think the real stress in life comes from that and if money becomes a problem with which you can't serve any of these things your life actually degrades a lot because none of these aspects are with you before marriage it just suddenly pops up so a good way for you to be happy and I think this episode is not about money anymore I think it's about your parents happiness your happiness your spouse's happiness and you getting up on a Monday with a smile a lot of it has to do with the chain around your neck and that chain is debt we make fun of this but it's the scariest freaking thing in the world the only thing you can do is in your 20s if you can save something and add that safety net all these entities will have a huge smile and I think that was the toughest thing after marriage that no one tells you but you have to live with okay sir I will save I will save money but the problem with that saving is the way life is designed you have the honeymoon K of relatives the marriage and all these other things n gezer shopping curtains married people will know this all your savings will vanish so ideally don't just save grow calculated you and your partner not just you I promise her she will also save I'll show her this video cool on to point number three imagine you're sitting in your beautiful living room with curtains you're watching something on television just then cut cut cut H you don't have a doorbell cut cut cut you open the door and there's a guy with a LTI saying give me my money Deb collector guys loan what you have to do is you have to make sure that you have a conversation on what each other's debt is so if she has a lot of debt or you have a lot of debt you should talk about that and this is another money talk that you have to do because now you're a unit you are both earning to pay each other's debt got it she'll also do it you're a unit now and that's what changes after you're married or you have a partner if she has a lot of debt to according to you I should not marry guys guys this is not a love gur program this is financial compatibility it's a general question sir fair you have to just know what each other's debt exposure is that's it once you have that conversation and you've written it down on a piece of paper you know you have to pay towards it that's all that conversation must happen sir I just have another question yeah this for you to personal I don't mind how do you and STI ma'am uh manage your expenses so of course we do it in a certain way um sti's been my best friend for what 16 years now so we have a yeah a crazy understanding of each other as soon as we receive our salaries which we would draw from learn app we take out a portion of it each and put it into our investments this is done on the first then I transfer a chunk of money to STI because actually STI runs the house I have all of this on an Excel sheet actually I do um so that Excel sheet the Excel sheet starts with the income for the month how much investment we've done I also maintain where the Investments are at this point and you update this month on month I update this every month and then uh whatever is left in our accounts we can spend on whatever else we like um it's equal it's done like this when we are out on a holiday I make all the spend but this is how we do it and uh pretty harmonious uh what you can do is you can also have a joint account um like this so this is your account this is my account this is a joint account we both can equally uh put in 40,000 40,000 30,000 30,000 and then this can be the expense account for the family oh family expenses any issues or something and whatever money you have you spend on other things that you want to do this is another way to also do it oh that's nice pretty simple um there's one thing over here that I'll admit okay when we sat on that Excel sheet and I said open your bank account tell me balance it felt a bit weird but 16 years of friendship understanding but we don't say that it feels awkward and then she said it and then I also put my number and I said okay do you have it do you have FD do you have mutual funds okay tell me and then once we went through the first question then it was easy then it was super easy but that first question that first step is like wearing your gym shoes and the at home as soon as you wear your gym shoes gy so the toughest thing is the first step which is asking that question and having that money conversation starting with the first line now what about those other expenses wedding here then you have honeymoon that you have then you have post animon preim that is out of scope of this video if you want us to do it put it in the comments give us some ideas what the other episode should be but I'll tell you the bottom line for this entire episode the bottom line is very simple a partnership is about trust whether it's a Business Partnership whether it's a partnership in sport whether you're working with someone whether you're in a team and of course when you're in a marriage and one of the things where trust breaks very frequently is flow of information moneyy information there is a high chance of trust deficit which you don't want it's basically just talk yes simple anyway tell us what else you want us to cover and see you in the next episode but like And subscribe bye-bye",

    "title_current": "Fast Fashion - From Trend to Trash",
    "transcript_full": "hey guys I'm going to show you the best apparel shop in the world welcome friends to the biggest apparel shop in the world here you'll find the latest trends in fashion and it's going to be super affordable too okay guys I'm obviously joking you can see all of the trends here are latest and absolutely free and I have some data to actually prove it too 60% of all apparel actually ends up in a landfill just like this and the interesting thing is the number of clothes is increasing every single year cuz people like you want clothes like this and all of this is due to a phenomena called Fast fashion but what the hell is fast fashion so Bob it [Music] [Applause] [Music] so at this point I have to ask this question pratique it's very lame to ask at this point but what is fast fashion People Like Us don't know what fashion is so fast fashion T Advanced okay so when you do a Google here's what you get okay mass produced mhm easy to purchase easily accessible new trends that happened all the time MH I think a while back they were only like winter and summer MH and you know you would change the clothes and guys like us it' be either ganji or no ganji what is ganji ganji what ganji I I don't come from your part of the country what is this ganji ganji looks like this okay it's Banyan okay okay but now today I learned one more Hindi word but with fast fashion okay the fashion can change every single month sometimes even faster and I think what ruined it was the internet now that you have a phone and you can scroll the next hottest thing is a few weeks away Oscar wild says a fashion is merely a form of ugliness so absolutely unbearable that we have to alter it every 6 months and so like you said at one point there were just two seasons which is why Oscar wild said 6 months we have to alterate right now there are like 10 to 15 Trends here like mentioned like 10 to 15 say it's not two seasons so earlier there were two seasons because one is hot so light clothes one is cold so different clothes now there are 10 to 15 Trends in a year and this actually means that if 15 a trend comes in and disappears within a span of 30 days this right now comes the gravity of the situation a trend that disappears before even a single month that is fast fashion hold on Abid a trend that disappears before a month abid's fast fashion is pretty slow no wonder he's a boomer fast fashion brands today produce new trends for up to 52 Seasons a year why isn't anyone telling them they're actually called weak but how did we go from the slow Yarns to fast fashion it all started in the 1800s when humans discovered the sorcerers needle I mean the sewing machine a single machine that led to the exponential growth in cloth manufacturing making clothes accessible to everyone but until the 20th century even with the textile mills most of the cloth manufacturing was still done at homes or small Workshop however the fashion industry changed during World War II the exponentially high prices of fabric during the war brought out the creativity of designers who were forced to create practical designs with minimal fabric the cargo pants you wear today or the short skirts your girlfriend flaun emerged as the by products of the war the necessity of the war became the modernday fashion and with the new opportunity fast fashion brands like were born in the 1900 entered the US with its quick supply chain model unlike traditional fashion brands which took 21 months to introduce a new lineup streamlined this process to create new products every 4 months the NY Times coined the transition as fast fashion thanks to capitalism other fashion retailers soon followed and this trend created artificial scarcity by disposing of clothes every single week today fast fashion brands just need 15 days to put new designs onto the shelves and the results of this sneaky little tactic has been rewarding really rewarding for them you know if owning a fast fashioned brand makes you the world's second richest person why wouldn't you start one now with fast fashion let's do the list of Pros it's a little little short okay okay a serious not there is some credit involved there is there is listen like if you look at fast fashion it meaningfully provides employment for a lot of people in less fortunate countries I I mean India has a lot of people who who work in fast fashion to give clothes to and the world maybe not te but I guess there are people in India Bangladesh vetnam southeast Asia plenty of countries right it's a lot of employment that they generate not just about the people who work in factories also to people who are retailers also people who help sell like but anything which is scaled no has that right outside of tech maybe employment but plenty of job and fair probably puts food in the mouth of people right agreed you have to granted the second thing of course is look I mean you can judge people all you want for saying that I want latest clothing EO Etc but just like everything else you can't be an aesthetic right clothes also make people feel good some people have body image you have to respect their choices as we can't ptif but it works like magic right like what you're saying you're sitting one day wanting validation from your life look it's very simple going through your going through your social media hear me out hear me out okay this is the consumption pattern you're going through you need some validation because you know we all do and you're going through it and you say oh I don't have this overcoat and with two special Taps that was more but you get two you get the point that Overcoat is delivered to my home the next day it's beautiful so accessibility is I agree it's a good thing I mean if we go to a place travel stay in a resort for 2 days for the sake of feeling great we can't criticize somebody who buys because both of them are politic activities right at some point you have to draw the line okay this is too much this is a line in the sand but just because somebody buys clothes because he or she feels better wearing those clothes you can't it makes the person feel good in a certain way body image you have to good and the third thing of course he's good uncle I no third thing is this is affordability also it does a certain amount of u Equalization of class in the sense that a long time back uh uh access was only for the High Street people very rich people immediately going to Gucci or buying some stuff now it has become accessible to a lot more people right again you can go under the tangent why do you have to feel like this people feel like this people feel like this think about this the biggest USP of fast fashion is its price the fast fashion industry has made clothing accessible for everyone even though you compromise on the quality it's allowed you to buy clothes on a budget without fast fashioned Brands the middle class would probably not have access to the latest fashion trends and these beautiful clothes the affordable fashion industry helps us bridge the gap between the rich and the poor then of course there's the economic benefit because clothing is now affordable people buy many clothes I mean a lot I mean let's think about America cuz we have the data for them they purchase about 64 clothing items a year and that's just the average American thanks to these purchases in 2023 the global fast fashion industry was valued at $193 billion um and this huge industry has another benefit employment actually I'm not sure of its benefit really you see almost all the clothes we wear are stitched By Hand by some person sitting on a sewing machine and fast fashion companies hire thousands of workers who work 12 hours a day in small rooms without brakes to create your little Poncho your little piece of clothing your little piece of style had this industry not existed these workers in small countries would probably not have any jobs and no food on the table but even though these companies are providing employment they also exploiting these workers since they have nowhere else to go so is this really a pro or actually a con well I'll leave you with something to ponder on now we look at the list of corns which is really long you think about textile right they're two types we have rayon and polyester now we know rayon is made with wood pulp so it's like semi synthetic and they'll turn it and shiny nice looks very beautiful when you get but degrades much faster and there's polyester a Pura crude is made from oil yeah it's literally made from oil yeah yeah I know and uh no I'm I'm talking to them yeah I know I know I know you know for you guys okay right and this is not like unused word or thrown away they're cutting down trees to make this sort of stuff now of course this is bad for the environment but on top of this is the clothes that are made from this one the wear and is really quick so it's designed in such a way after a few months it actually by the 10th wash I think the and it stops uh being presentable which is what you buy in the first place and microplastics are actually in this I didn't know this until we did research for the show the microplastics comes from this in the ocean 35% of all microplastic is not that bottle that you're drinking out of it's from clothes dude it's from some teenager or People Like Us wanting some validation from the world buying clothes because and the fish are eating it yeah yeah so this is something which I found interesting right so I was planning to actually do that for this episode I have a 15 maybe more than that year old t-shirt okay right and uh I think it's 2011 or 2008 it was from one of those uh like um like somebody gifted me a French Open t-shirt right like the one which players we okay unreal how new it looks right no it it doesn't even have like the slight fibers degrading not even that so it was like built to last it was a it was used War by act incentive right to do that anymore at least for fast fashion retailer the F fast fashion the problem of course is you have to necessarily build the clothes in such a way that they they degrade faster so that the consumer is forced to buy a new one but yeah so there is our consumption which is an issue there is the entire environmental effect of our consumption I think another thing which uh people are it's a double-edged SW in the sense that there's a lot of labor involved right now of course fast fash is fast accessible cheap Etc because it is cheap the problem with that also is it is cheap and someone else is paying the price for that cheapness price for that cheap so like obviously the people inside Vietnam Bangladesh Etc I know they not paid a lot but where do you draw a line because on the one hand you can say that boss they are getting paid a lot but on the other hand you have to argue that they are getting paid something yeah right so it's very difficult to U say that there has to be a minimum wage Etc because then maybe it won't be so cheap so it's a complex so you're saying a sweat shop is okay because it's providing some level of income I'm not saying that all I'm saying is that if the shop is not at sweat maybe the supply demand of the world will change in such a way that maybe that shop won't even exist right and that's a problem so we can't sit here and pass judgment he boss you know in Bangladesh you have a sweat shop where people are getting nothing the problem is if it did not come at that price point maybe nobody would get nothing right so it's easy so it's a it's a very very tricky topic 100% if you've liked the episode so far hit that like And subscribe and don't forget to comment but this is what really really worried me so I was actually um or let me put this way right what do you mean so if I say prati involuntarily gave me money what does that mean prati is an idiot no it doesn't mean that it means that I forced you to give me money basically or I involuntarily made pratique work for me basically I D Mar I made work correct correct so I was actually reading about right and one of the reviews said there may be involuntary labor involved I'm like boss what the is this involuntary labor what do you mean by involuntary labor people involuntary why why don't you just sponsored article I mean why don't you just bloody call it slave labor it's a very serious problem right so and you have to again think of if China is getting slave labor extracted or quote unquote as they call involuntary labor where is it coming from is it coming from shinjang but you know where it comes from yeah this comes from us like you and me and the people watching this right like think about it everything's demand and Supply we know the answer to this the answer is very simple we ask for cheaper clothes on time that's an oversimplification because think about it right if the world starts demanding and saying we want sustainable clothes I I don't know how this will happen by the way why would someone want sustainable clothes in Mass but if if they did sustainable clothes um which is Affordable and everyone's got decent pay at these places I'm sure industry will figure it out but there's no incentive for the consumer to demand that yet is where I disagree right because um if China did not do the kind of things it did yes right it doesn't necessarily mean that we will not get something at a price point I think it only means the profit margin a has will decrease if they are forced to pay better like see for example right I am not sure where the cheapness is coming from number one I'm not sure where the labor Arbitrage is coming from is so there is a middle layer right which is the cost and there's a bottom layer which is the pat yeah assuming that the cost is in elastic or the price is in elastic and we are roughly going to pay the same thing anyway correct by reducing the middle line which is the cost of Labor people can increase their Pat margin quite a bit Yeah my doubt is this instead of going to a Bangladesh or a Vietnam or an India or something if somebody figures out that this group of political minorities can be enslaved to produce at free cost that doesn't mean it's on us it does not mean it's on us because so they can decide to reduce their profit margins a bit and still probably give us the clothing at the same price but I think in the system no one's incentivized to do that yet because of the shareholder value maximization correct concept concept I wonder we were talking about this backstage right I think 1 kg of cotton is 10,000 L of water oh I didn't know this you weren't listening when I was talking no I don't normally listen when you're but just imagine that right like there's water also I I wonder what the cost of all of this is to the environment emission wise yeah emission wise it's quite a bit and the problem is it's for a discretionary purchase which if we are able to like in the sense right a lot of fast fashioned purchase is stimulated by external stimuli like marketing campaigns or influencers saying something etc etc so it's strictly a discretionary spend I think that's okay problem is that you will discard it after a few months because after the 10th watch wash it's not shiny anymore cor yeah that's exactly what I'm saying in the sense that all of this is happening for something we can easily fix like try to use it longer or try to not buy so much I wonder if it's manufactured in a way so that in the 10th wash it's not worth it h i wonder come on guys fast fashion isn't that bad I mean look at the tag on this t-shirt it says join life it means t-shirt is sustainable okay this is all join life logo on the tag simply means that this tag is sustainable not the T-shirt just the tag not the T-shirt this is a classic example of greenw washing and the fast fashion companies are good at greenwashing as Walter White is at cooking you know what but greenwashing isn't the only thing these companies are good at they're also great at slive involuntary labor unsafe working condition s unfair wages long working hours child labor and the list goes on and on in 2013 more than 1,100 workers passed away after a sweat shop collapsed in Bangladesh the worst part is that these workers had been complaining about cracks for days but because the sweat shop owner refused to pay salaries if they didn't come in the workers had no choice but to work but even after all tragedies the ethics of fast fashioned brands are strong as the pillars of the sweatsh I mean think about why these companies have stayed so strong it's because of their diversification no no not inequity it's in pollution be it land water or air fast fashioned brands have laid their hands on it all the textile industry consumes 79 trillion lers of water that's 4% of the world's fresh water annually and is also responsible for Global carbon emissions 10% it's more pollution than what automobiles create but wait it's not over yet over 92 million tons of textile waste is dumped every year and if you had to imagine that it's like throwing away a truck full of clothes every second because these Brands constantly create new fashion and stimulate demand the consumers get tempted to buy new clothes that they don't even need and possibly won't even wear once and this is exactly what these Brands want but the consumers we can talk about this practice say we don't like it to slow down the fast Trends remember all they're doing is meeting our demands and your choice can save tens or thousands of liters of water and some money from your pocket so what's the solution should we just stop buying clothes okay okay but on a serious note what can you do see for one right um at least for people who can afford it like I said right that that uh French Open t-shirt which I was talking about that lasted 15 years the initial investment in that shirt is obviously higher but it'll last longer so if people can afford to buy good stuff that lasts a really long time I think people should make a conscious effort to go to that right and the other thing of course is somehow buying environmentally sustainable clothing and using the same old clothes again and again for a long time that has to be perceived as cool we have to start the trend where somebody wearing really old clothes really tough I know it's very tough but talk to your cool friend who can do it cuz you can't but on a serious note again again personal experience um I have repaired clothes several times because I don't know I I I have a thing so it's probably middle class India you know Peak middle class India thing when you grow up so I actually repair a lot of shoes I don't throw them away yeah and it's it's nice right like so of course there's a cheap thrill that you go to a cobbler and uh give it to him and he repairs it and gives it back you feel oh I saved so much money then you're reusing them then you also feel okay you're not throwing it away you're being like a waste person none of that right so I realize that if you are willing to put in a little bit more effort like probably 20 30 minutes more there's so much repairs you can do there's one more thing right so I recently noticed this right East Asian cultures whether India Japan Korea Etc we have like a cultural thing of reduce reuse recycle right like when I was when I was small I was handed my Elder Brothers stuff the hand me- Downs yeah yeah hand me downs very common stuff right there's nothing and that's considered good it's considered good and we consciously make an effort to so this's this joke which we say right in India a shirt starts its life as a T-shirt and at the end of the life cycle it is the mob I I think it's a I think it's a great thing right don't don't why do you want to buy a special microfiber mop you can use your old cloth dude no and I'm serious and this one is microplastic in it so but but but but on a so you can actually I think the most important thing is that you have to have intent once you have the intent that look it's it's just this I think reduce reuse recycle that concept is beautiful it's just three very powerful words if you consciously make an effort to reduce like reduction is simple and their cool Trends also minimalism is also a trend considered absolutely where people live in smaller houses smaller everything and they are happier life and focus on other things versus these crazy dopamine hits and if you open your and if you have very few things to choose from life becomes significantly simp no Paradox of choice no Paradox of choice you don't have to worry every day like so for example Steve Jobs Mark Zug all these boys have the same dress did good so that is one thing reuse is again a massive concept so again one part of reuse is how many people actually consciously make an effort to donate their clothes and shoes if it's something which you can really do right for example one of the biggest things which uh I learned is uh when clothes right typically they get stored away as memorably or something but you can actually donate to an organization on the same day just after your wedding you can donate it yeah yeah they'll take it away I do that I did that so that's nice the thing is it actually somebody else can use it or you know there are a lot of people who don't have privilege they can use it it's almost brand new it's a nice thing right so and you'll never wear it again you'll never wear it guaranteed it's guaranteed I mean unless guaranteed unless I mean unless I finally comes recycling again not a difficult thing to do now India is catching up plenty of places where people are recycling stuff it doesn't take effort to collect everything together and donate it to I mean give it to somebody who will make sure that it is getting recycled yeah if you do all this thing but I think the most important thing is that see it's like this right where there's a will there's a way if you really think okay I want to reduce my consumerism and I'm going to find ways to do that it's not difficult to do that I think the change has to come from within it's easy for people to sit around and say okay some NGO has to take lead government has to incentivize nothing if everybody thinks K boss let me just requestion the way I'm living it and think what I can do U maybe Aid is right the solution to the fast fashion problem starts at home and just like other problems that you face at home if you don't know how to solve a problem call Amma I mean your grandmother yes your grandmother knows the solution on how to reduce your shopping spree reuse some of your clothes and also recycle those old clothes to make something new the concept of reduce reuse and recycle isn't new at all and just like Abid said Pik you know South Asian cultures have traditional solutions to this problem you'll be surprised in Japan you have kintsugi where you have small holes in your garments you can fix them by patching them with gold thread making them even prettier in Korea you have joako and bojun which is this dress this beautiful gorgeous dress has been made using leftover fabric which would have been thrown away in any other place but Korea has culturally used leftovers to create something new and this doesn't end here in China you have the phrase zi buan this proverb which translates to make cloth and mend what daor this proverb emphasizes the importance of both creating new clothes and taking care of EX listing ones by mending them and this is not just restricted to foreign countries even back home in India we have tons of similar Solutions across the country that's weaved into our cultural roots in Himachal Pradesh we have tanka bags in West Bengal we have K quilts or cets that are being used for ages now and in the South we have one more example that's the Pali weaving technique from telengana not just that there are several projects or movements run by NOS too like a Chad miii movement which helped women gain livelihood by making bed sheets using old saries and clothes and if you're not still convinced think about our own families our own homes remember those times when your elder brother would finally hand you his cool t-shirt when you use your favorite t-shirt to such an extent that one day Mom looked at it and said the good old days anyway basically all of these examples and memories only go to show that the solution to this fast fashion is right at home with you taking the first step so talking about intent we actually have this um disconnect between the maximizing of shareholder value consumption and companies correct so there's actually an interesting thing I read you know the company Patagonia hiking gear hiking gear stuff right so there's a letter by the founder let me read parts of it okay um Earth is now our only shareholder if we have any hope of a thriving Planet much less a business it's going to take all of us in doing what we can with the resources what I have here's what I want to do first 1% of the sales each year we started to give back towards the environment this is how we started top Lan Top Line mhm after that we changed the company's purpose to we're in business to save our home planet now I didn't know how to solve this first I thought was to sell Patagonia and take the money and donate it all towards the environment second was take it public but then who would become the new shareholder maximization would happen from the shareholder side and again the vision will be destroyed instead of going public we said we're going purpose now hear this out 100% of the company's voting stock transfers to Patagonia purpose trust which is a new vehicle okay and their job is to protect company's values Etc and 100% of the non- voting stock is given to another to to another nonprofit called Hold Fast Collective whose whose purpose is to fight the environment now is this marketing speak could be like I don't know but I've not read anything like this could this actually change the way other people also think at least it's a first step yeah it's a first step very big brand doing this and I think they do all the checks Abid in all the pros and cons we talked about they massively high quality built to last all of those things you can reuse you can recycle Etc all those checks are also in place so maybe um if more companies did this things would get a little better and in this entire thing right fast fashion uses a lot of cotton okay and we have this fight that's happening between traditional cotton how it's grown with the farmers and this modern cotton and you can imagine modern cotton you want higher yield big quantities cheaper and this is what fast fashion actually demanding they want more cotton fast in a short period of time larger me because we know why and all this cotton is actually bad for the farmer because his margin reduces he has to do fertilizer and all these things to get the yield up correct his margin reduces but he hopes that the volume is better correct and in India we use something called BT cotton I think I've heard this name genetically modified cotton so we thought this since this is interesting why don't we talk about genetically modified crops and its effects God that that looks so natural in the next episode like And subscribe see you in the next episode",

    "transcript_full": "[Music] a sir sir sir sir thank you for increment now abish thank you sir increments what's the problem walk me to my room sir now I can make 1 CR how you 1 10 years you won't make one no no I'll tell you I'll tell you I philosophy is simple so I'll invest the increment percentage okay full n SI and you'll make one in 10 years come here sir every week how do you come up with a 1 CR plan now I'm smart what's the plan see I'll tell you I'll invest my increment in mutual funds the 10% goes into mutual funds yes and then it will make me one CR in 10 years or so my Excel sheet says but hold on you selected mutual funds and they going to make you 1 CR how did you select the mut I I know just just look at this you see this list you see these top three funds the first one what top return funds correct returns genius look at this no what's this number got it 36% 36% cagr and you projected this into the future 10 years and that's how you money Miss not cool tell me one thing uh when you select a stock what do you look at to select a stock sometimes you buy stocks also right what do you look at you have only taught me I look at the fundamentals sales revenue profits I look for the sectors it sector banking just in case if it sector goes down banking saves my portfolio nice sounds complicated how many metrics is this 10 15ish I don't know okay and how many metrics did you look for mutual funds returns and the reason is ke mutual funds are managed by experts and all you have to do is select a fund correct actually no there is a way to actually analyze mutual funds as well so instead of looking at 15 20 metrics like you do why don't I tell you some 1 2 3 4 5 6 metrics that we look at and based on that you can select a mutual fund you don't want to see me make 1 now I don't know about that but I don't want to see you die because your expectations are too high let's [Music] begin so the first thing we're going to do is look at something called rolling Returns what you are looking at is cagr this is a different kind of Ro give me the poker chips okay so what a mutual fund manager is essentially doing money yeah and he is thank you juice I'll ask you questions and if you make the wrong you have to eat drink Thea juice cool okay cool so a mutual fund manager is basically investing in different companies and diversifying your risk let's say with an equities now sometimes out of pure luck which is completely fine one of the stock does extremely well does that make sense yes is return is massively better than last year's because this one stock or sector or a group of stocks did extremely well and it skews the average and because of that the portfolio looks really nice in terms of returns so how do we know that the manager has luck or skill on his side so we look at something called rolling returns so now think about Cricket in cricket if you have a batsman and he's scoring 40 40 40 50 50 50 that means there is some consistency you see a pattern but what if someone scores example there 200 somewhere in in one game and the next few games is 40 40 40 but his average is also 50 who is actually better the one which is who is going through consistent average exactly same thing in mutual fund so basically we need consistency when we selecting a fund and that's important sir I already know this okay then can I get a laptop so what a rolling return does is basically you try to capture multiple returns at the same time so let's say we have six years to look at okay we look at year 1 to year 4 Isa returns are 20% now let's start from year two so two to year five five so 2 to five returns are 16% now let's go to year 3 three to year is 88.7% okay so if you had to go forward you'll say year four to year seven and so on and so forth so you won't see the average of the last seven years you will dissect it a little bit and see it's a rolling return makes sense now this is fund a okay now the same thing we'll do on fund B which is 30% for first then 20% Then 177% almost 18% 18% so on one hand we have 20% 16% 8% on the other hand we have 30% 20% and almost 18% which is more consistent fund B clearly right and both can actually have a similar cagr similar return but you want to go with the one that's more consistent all you have to do is Google the fund name click on rolling Returns on whatever website you go to and just compare whether the numbers are almost the same sir this is easy so basically I'll just compare two funds and it's done right oh wait wait so when you look at when you look at a fund you have to compare it to The Benchmark which is for every fund The Benchmark is different another thing you can also do is compare this with the category average as well to see how other funds are performing what is category a so categories basically you might invest in a certain Mutual fun category like a hybrid fund or a large cap Equity Fund Etc or an Els fund you just compare s funds in that category where does your fund stand it's a comparison with the category average this can also be found online not an easy this is easy it's easy so you you compare with the Benchmark you compare with the category average rolling returns and you're good the next performance metric is the sharp ratio what ratio sharp ratio sharp ratio sharp with the E before explaining what sharp ratio is we should actually explain what standard deviation is hello let's imagine there are two aircrafts of two different brands flying from Mumbai to Delhi the flight let's say is 2 hours long okay now one flight operator is usually late so on one day it's 35 minutes late on another day it is 40 minutes late on one day it is 10 minutes late but if you look at it mostly it's about 25 minutes late that's an average it's 25 minutes away from the mean the expected the 2 hours so standard deviation is 25 minutes okay the second flight is late only about 10 minutes most of the time so standard deviation is 10 minutes 108 10 so now that you know AA standard deviation of time is 25 minutes the other is 10 minutes which one which will yes obviously of course this is what standard deviation is how far away do you deviate from the mean now to explain sharp ratio first let me ask you a question question let's suppose you have an investment option that I'm giving you and I'm saying there is a possibility of making a 100% return on this I'll take it and there is a second option J you will make only 10% as a possibility which one would you pick okay now what if I told you the risk in this is 100% if it doesn't work out I will get your house and if in this one J you're making 10% if this doesn't work out Max you lose is 1% which one would you pick now but 10% is much lesser than 100% which one would you pick I love my house so what you just did was you didn't look at just returns you looked at risk if the risk is too much and this is stupid risk you just won't take the risk right H correct H the this is what the sharp ratio does it Compares your returns to the risk that you're taking because look at a fund we say 30% returns but how much risk are you actually taking we want to know it's calculating basically your returns uh divided by the standard deviation of that fund now the interesting thing is numerator it's actually coming from the difference between your fund and a risk-free interest rate you know why risk-free risk free FD yeah fixed deposit please sir three pleas FD is not risk-free your risk-free number actually comes from government securities [Music] ma actually I'll show you one example this fund that I've opened over here it's sharp ratio is 1.43 so this is good decent I would compare this fund to all other funds in the same category and see what their shop ratio returns Etc are so if I'm looking for elss fund I look for Sharp ratio comparing I'll get the best sort of fund and remember you can't optimize for just one metric you have to have a balance of everything so now let's see a risk metric what do all mutual fund ad say mutual fund say n PCO PCO mutual funds are subject to Market risk beta let's talk about beta so basically beta measures the funds volatility Against The Benchmark it could be Nifty could be Nifty 100 could be whatever but that's what beta measures so you will tell me the answer now okay I'll give you a clue you also guess so a beta of one means your fund volatility and The Benchmark volatility is the same it's one now let's say your fund is 1.2 more volatile by how much 2% 20 20% and let's say the beta is8 it is 20% less volatile than the Benchmark that's it now the question is which one will you choose higher than one lower than one just select the one which is equal to the Benchmark no I think it's a very subjective ratio but there is another ratio which actually answers this question to a number and it's called the capture ratio which will have another ratio there's an upside capture ratio and there's a downside capture ratio so let's say Nifty moves up 5% okay and let's say your fund moved up only 1% it's a very bad fun it's very bad but what if your fund moved up also moved up 5% though it's a good fund now it's upside capture ratio is one so let's say Nifty moved up 10% and your upside capture ratio is two that means your fund moved up 20% which means you want an upside capture ratio greater than one now what do you think will be the answer for the downside capture ratio I will not look at it no no no no you want to make sure that your downside capture ratio is less than one so if Nifty Falls 5% you want the fund to fall oh not 5% less than 5% less than 5% of course last two metrics we will go to a assets under management which is the total amount the fund has in its Corpus that it's investing uh usually what happens is people go to a category and they click AUM and they see the largest fund and they think that's a good fund because everyone's bought it I'm not saying don't don't buy the highest AUM fund or buy the smallest fund not saying that so what I would say is remove AUM from your metrics when you're looking at um a fund the last one is the total expense ratio you know what this is right uhuh what is it TR or total expense ratio is the fee that the mutual fund company charges you to handle your money I knew this selfconfidence is the key so what you want to do is you want to make sure that you're investing in a fund just TR is acceptable again don't go just for the lowest TR because what's the acceptable te I don't know you'll have to look at all the funds in your category and see what the range is because the TR changes and I can't give you a range for it so now you have six metrics all of them on your screen and I hope all of them in your head when you look for a mutual fund it'll take less than 5 minutes for you to go through all of these five or six metrics but once you do you'll be a little more confident no one can pick the best mutual fund a stock to give you the best returns nobody all of these things are done so you can sleep well at night knowing you did everything you could in Your Capacity and is and that's the true key to happiness also for appraisal also and for returns expectation also keep them low hope for the best appraisal expectation should be high No it should be low so then if you you give us if it's decent then you're happy thank you sir for the appra no there's no appraiser I hope you like this episode if you did give a like say something in the comments and see you in the next episode and I'll get like and subsscribe sales so imagine these are [Laughter]",

episode we're going to talk about credit card scams that happen to people like you and me and we have no clue about we're going to talk about the good not really mostly the bad cuz certainly the Internet isn't telling us what the hell's happening so let's begin I know what you're thinking you'll never fall for a credit card fraud because well you follow the de influencing series but you know what people our age who are working in nice companies get a salary watching Netflix doing all these things with a life are the people who are getting scammed the most it's the educated class which is actually losing money to these scams so it's really important for you to watch this the credit card spend in India has increased from 14.3 lakh in FY 2223 to 18.3 lakh CR in FY 2324 I can also see from the stats over here that the number of frauds in the last 2 years has increased from 2,600 to 3,600 and in rupee terms it's about 155 CR rupees every single year so let's start with the first scam the first kind of fraud is skimming and it feels like but it actually can happen to you let's suppose you're at a petrol pump and you hand out your nice card to the person to make the payment now in this kind of scam the person will take the card and first run it through a card reader that's right a card reader the card reader will actually take all the information of the card like the card number the CVV the expiry if there's a magnetic strip Etc and store it now the person will use the same card and insert it into the POS machine in many cases the card reader is right next to the POS machine so it looks exactly the same you can't even tell the different machines and then you enter your PIN now at this point he can find out what your PIN is by sneakily seeing it through a CCTV camera or maybe finding a way to peek through it while he's close by that's why they say make sure you enter your PIN and no one can actually see it in this case the scamster has both the things through the card reader he now has the entire details of your card which he can replicate into a physical card and he sneakily found out what your PIN is with these two things you can imagine what he can do the person can make transactions and you will one day receive a message saying XYZ money has been withdrawn from my account and you will be thinking what now what can scammers do once they've obtained this information the first thing is very simple they can obviously make a copy of the card and since they have the pin they can make unauthorized transactions with your card the second thing is identity theft a lot of scamsters out there are doing things that we have no idea about but require a new identity and with all this information they can use some part of your identity and connect it to some other scam that they're doing and the Third Kind is where someone doesn't want to take any of these risks and the scammer actually sells it to another B scammer who figures out what to do with all this data in all three scenarios it's not good for people like you and me what we need to make sure is take precautions and the simplest thing over here is if you can do UPI that's probably better if you are Swip typing your card make sure you insert the card in the PO machine and you don't give it to someone who takes the card away your PIN is your security guard your PIN is your key you don't want to give away your key we found this unfortunate incident amongst the thousands out there where his credit card or in this case debit card was misused the person was near a metro station a person was standing beside him started talking to him somehow saw the pin and eventually withdrew the money when you are at an ATM or swiping your card it is a very personal transaction that you are doing because it has your information and your PIN no one should be around and if someone is making you uncomfortable cancel the damn transaction and do it somewhere where it's safe and here is the second scam this one is a little more scary it's called a fishing scam a fishing scam is basically a way for them to obtain information they are not supposed to but you are actually giving them that information not knowing that you gave that information that's what fishing means in India when you're making an online payment there is a layer of security that prevents anyone from making an unauthorized transaction even if they have information on your credit card and that layer is called the OTP only you have that OTP and we always know do not share the OTP with anyone it's secret you always see this when you get that SMS but what if a scamster found a way to obtain that OTP and you shared it with him without knowing you Di did it an actual case in Mumbai where a lady got a call from XYZ bank she was already part of by the way the bank representative called and said that she has a new credit card with a higher credit limit but because she has an iPhone it won't get activated so the bank because she's such a good customer is also sending an Android phone a brand new one that she can use to activate the new card she was obviously really excited and the delivery was amazing all this stuff came the same day she hurriedly opened the pack took out the phone and activated her card on that phone now the thing about the phone is that it came pre-installed with two applications do secure and secure Envoy authenticator now these softwares may be fine but the scamster or the bank representative in this case actually found a way to mirror whatever was happening on that Android phone to their own device which went now because they had the details about the card they were able to take the OTP from the screen mirroring that was enabled on that phone but the question Still Remains the OTP would have come to that phone OTP they copied because they're screen mirroring how did they find out about that woman and that card in the first place well there exists the dark web where a lot of people are selling credit card information to people and there are websites which are selling this illegally as soon as a sophisticated scamster gets his hands on them he already has your card details and your phone number and the scam begins with the call to the lady saying hi abishek sir I'm calling from XYZ Bank do you have 2 minutes the point of this entire scam was this you cannot use a device given by someone else and there must be no way for anyone to access that OTP on your phone those are your keys no one can have access to it which also means you shouldn't be downloading unauthorized apps another way to do the same scam without a call is simply sending you a WhatsApp saying that you won XYZ all you need to do is download this application and claim your reward that app could start reading your sms's and send it to someone else SMS readers are also reading the key to your bank account which is the OTP make sure you're really careful on what's installed on your phone and of course people around you trying to find out what that OTP is hey guys so we launched two new channels 01 women and 01 Hindi do check that out and now back to the episode the second way a fishing scam can work is through remote access systems and you might have guessed what this is you're sitting down and one day you get an SMS and the SMS is a sequence of messages saying someone's trying to enter your bank account and set resetting the password and he has failed and now your account has been suspended all you need to do is click on this link download this application and reactivate your account thankfully the the security systems are pretty good at this bank once you do this you immediately see a 1 lak rupe transaction happen on your C what the hell just happened one the sequence of messages you see over here are not from the bank it's actually from the scamster all these look really legitimate because they're meant to look legitimate the last message is a fishing scam where they give you a link usually the bank will never tell you to download an app via a link because that's just not how usually banks operate you download the app and enter some details now what's happened is that all your calls and smss are forwarded to the scamster and I'm not making this up things like this happen all the time where false apps or applications are forwarding important information to someone else without you even knowing you have to make sure you don't have unauthorized applications on your phone and second there is an easy way to know if any of your calls or messages are being forwarded simply follow these steps on your keypad type star21 # from this you'll find out if if any of your data or messages are being forwarded or not now in the case you see that there is forwarding then all you need to do is type #h 002 # and from this all call forwarding will be erased another thing you can do is set daily limits for your transactions for online for ATM for posos machines based on what you're normal usage is you can also make sure that you don't have anyone next to you when you're withdrawing money making transactions no one peing at your card keep checking your credit card statement for any payments that you may not have made and probably don't save your card on websites even though your information is tokenized it's best just to enter the card details every single time why do you want to save 10 seconds if it's slightly safer to enter the details yourself and I know what you're thinking UPI safe UPI safe right right um we made a video on UPI scams please and if you have any stories tell us in the comments below but please watch that video",

    "transcript_full": "I'll have to work till 70. No, no, I'll have to work till 60 to get retired. Of course. Of course. What you sir? You'll have to help me help you retire early. I don't know 45. But I'll have to buy I'll have to buy a house. I'll have to buy a car. I have I have to go on a vacation as well. Done. So, I'll make sure you can do all of this and you can retire at 45. Does that make sense? That means you'll never work after 40 or 45 ever in your life. So, Igbar, can you run me by this sheet? What What's over here? So this is my bank balance right now. The cash in bank three lakh rupees. Yes, I have three lakhs. Three lakhs. And this you will invest. This I will invest. Yes, I will invest. Pura pura. Yes. Okay. Then you have monthly expense which is 65,000 and you are earning 67,000 a month. Damn, you spend way too much and basically inflation is 7%. What is this 12% nonsense? 12% sir. 12%. Do not assume 12%. We'll reduce this to 10%. An annual salary increment 20%. What world are you living in? 8% later. So basically now what I see over here this is this is your age going from 29 all the way to 85. Okay fine. Then we have invested corpus which is three lakhs. Correct. This is increasing every year. Here's what we want. We want this corpus should be so big that when you retire even though you're not working you can withdraw money from here and this money never ends. Correct. What age I'll retire? So according to according to your sheet at 60 when you retire the money finishes at 71. So to survive beyond 70 you will be no money. So basically by the end of this conversation these 20 years that you have to work from age 40 to 60 we want to completely eliminate. So after 40 you'll never work again. Correct? So I'll mark this in orange and this will be gone. Sir I know what you'll do. So what I know so what you'll do is you'll increase my salary from 8% to 15%. I will increase why increase the salary sir. We have to reduce your working years. Why are you changing salary? Come here. I I have to tell you something very interesting. Come. Yes. So what you've done over here is you're expecting 15%. 20%. But actually actually look at this. There is the deote report which actually says the average is 8%. And that's why we'll keep the salary increment at 8%. Now moving on to the returns. Let's keep it at 10%. My portfolio is giving 20% return. 10% actual actual portfolio. Yeah, we'll play a game. 20. Okay. The game will be played by you by me and Aishek. You have to put your score and we'll play it right now. It's only going to take 30 seconds. These are the returns for 3 years. Don't use a calculator. The first year is 24%. 14.9% second year, 12% the third year. What's the average? What's the average? Uh 15%. Okay. So for the next few years, how much can you expect Nifty to give? Around 15%. Roughly. Roughly, right? This is called a bias, recency bias. You look at the last few years and you assume that the same thing will continue forever. So now if you look back, these were actual numbers I rounded off. If you go from year 2000 to 2024, you average it, it is 11.7%. Now I'll tell you the third thing before we reduce your expenses and bring them down to 30,000. It is actually where is it? It's you. Oh, my portfolio is doing well today. I'll buy my car now. Yes, you're not wrong, Bess. Yeah, I'm not. But also look at this right. It's not just you. It's you too. Sebi said in the first one year 50% of mutual funds are actually redeemed which means people sell it. Sir, tell me one thing. If I want to buy a car, huh? Then also I'll not withdraw. This is my life savings. No, I'll have to withdraw. Correct. And I think this is where personal finance, all this content online gets wrong. Everyone's basically telling you that you should not go to parties, go for vacations, buy the iPhone, buy all these things, including us in all of this content we've made. But there is one caveat you have probably not noticed because you have not planned it well. That's why you're not able to do it. So what you actually have to do is plan your investments well. And that can be done with the help of SWP, a systematic withdrawal plan. It's basically the opposite of an SIP which is a systematic investment plan. Everyone knows it how in an SIP you invest every month. Most people do a month. In an S SWP you withdraw every day, month and because you're withdrawing it at a certain rate, the original corpus keeps growing. So you are working till 60. Now this has to reduce this orange portion has to become zero. So what I will do is I will keep the salary increment at 20% and investment return 12%. Like you had done earlier. Now let's see what happens when we delete this income from after 40 years. Even after 20% increment this money will not last beyond 69 years of age. Yeah. Now let's understand why. First look at your expenses. These fixed expenses look fine, but you are spending 25,000 every month on party and trips plus 15,000 more on phone EMI. No. How do you expect your money to last forever if you keep spending on all this stuff? Instead, you should distribute these big expenses over a period of time. Sir, but then how will I buy the stuff that I want? See, even after cutting these out, you are still left with 5,000 and you can spend it however you want. So now you are now retired at age 40. And age 41 onwards, how much are you earning? Zero. Now I want you to imagine what will happen at age 40 onwards. You're not working at all. Go relax. Relax on the sofa. Age 41. Never working. Go lie down quickly and look up into the sky because now you are financially free. Money will last for a long time. One day goes, no work. 6 months go, one year goes, 20 years, 40 years go by and you're absolutely never working again. This is not the definition of being financially free. I know you don't want to be compulsive in going to the office and have to work. You still want to work but on stuff you enjoy. Right. Right. How much will you earn? At least 40,000 to 42,000 you'll be able to earn every month. Right. Yeah. Let's also consider you will get a 6% increase in this income every year. Yeah. Okay. But at 60 I want to stop this freelance work also. Correct. Now let's see. Will the corpus ever end? It's increasing forever. This will actually never stop increasing and I'll keep on withdrawing. You'll keep withdrawing from the corpus. So it's 6.84 crores at age 60 and even at 85 it's continuing to grow. So the realization here is your retirement is always in your hand. It just depends on what you want today. So if you increase the expenses over here, your retirement may never come. So it's fine to buy that car. It's fine to go on that holiday. It's fine to buy anything that you like. But it should make sense if it if your money finishes in the future, then maybe you should wait. And remember this is very worst case, right? I don't think your salary increment will be 8%. With the way things are going, I think at certain periods of time when you get a spike, there'll be a sudden jump. But at that point, if you decide to spend that money, then there is no point of that sudden jump. This sheet does not plan your finances. It tells you that even if you save 5,000, 8,000 or 12,000 rupees today, it's going to affect the Abishek of 60 years old. Sir, I have one last question. Yeah. What is the cost of freedom? It's an exam of you know in school when you had an exam coming up you can either be the kid who went home every day and did a revision and a weekly revision. So he had to prepare very little before the exam. But if you were like some people I was I was always prepared. Some people one night before you would study 2 days before the exam. Right? So now you have to decide. Do you want to be the guy who invests a little bit now so that later in life there is less pressure and therefore there is less stress and that's how you define freedom or are you the guy who says I want to enjoy now I'm going to go play I'm not going to study and I'm going to study one day before the exam in other words I will work really hard in my 40s and 50s and 60s and I'll deprive myself of the stuff I may need in the future because I want to enjoy my life today. You don't have to take these extreme decisions. It can be somewhere in the middle. What do you want to be? The good student.",

    "transcript_full": "[Music] le le le mutual fund returns Le best Returns come on Sir excuse please what category of mutual fund are you interested in sir show me a very good balanced Advantage fund sir how did you select balance Advantage fund small cap gave the best returns last year this is the one for you uh sir which Fund in small cap sir uh well you can choose between A and B but a is best because the returns are best simple but B Mar better but a has the best returns this is for you finish story but this is not the risk appetite or investment Horizon we're looking for so risk appetite sharp ratio va va all of these things is all nonsense get the best mutual fund with the best returns like this one H something was obviously wrong with that sales pitch I mean can you really select a mutual fund based based on the highest returns and we'll do a simple experiment to prove whether this actually works or not we'll talk about the good we'll talk about the bad cuz clearly those guys really won't so let's start with the first [Music] [Music] activity you've probably never invested Ed in a mutual fund and are thinking to start your first sip but you know the internet is filled with the best mutual fund returns you'll see videos reals blogs articles even very nice apps finding the best returned mutual fund for you but is this the right way to even think about selecting a mutual fund so we thought we'll start with an activity so this first activity is really interesting what we want to do is invest in mutual funds which had the highest return and hold them for a really long period of time now the interesting thing here is the highest mutual fund returns will obviously beat the index so if you're able to hold on to these winners for a long time we should make two times three times five times of what the market is giving so let's turn this into a game what we'll do is we'll select any fund which has at least a 10year performance history that way we'll get some good funds which have some history we can actually back test second we'll select mutual funds with at least 500 CR AUM and what I'll do is I'll select data from 2011 and start investing in this back test in 2012 then I'll continue to invest in them all the way to 20120 that's 9 years that's a good amount of data isn't it also I'll select four kinds of funds or four categories of funds right here so that we don't have too many categories notice all of them are equity now what I'll do is I'll invest in the top three funds of 2011 but I'm investing in 2012 and just to be fair I'll invest 10,000 in each of these funds now in 2013 I'll do the same thing I'll take out 2012's data find the top three funds invest 10 10 10,000 in each of them and I'll repeat this every single year always investing in the top three mutual funds looking at the previous year's data now I want you to think about this for 9 years this investment happened we were totally algorithmic about it and quantitative about it we didn't select it out of any emotion and we always selected the top returning funds so this should work we should beat the index by four or five times right and we did this over a long period of time right so let's see what the results are so remember we've invested 30,000 rupees every year here for 9 years which means we've invested how much 2.7 lakh rupees now let me open the results to see how much money we would have made on 1st of December 2020 we would have made an amazing 5.7 lakh rupees okay and that's an annualized return of 12.6% 12.6% doesn't Nifty give roughly that much despite investing in the top three funds every year we didn't beat the index by a large percentage I don't know why why is it 12.6% maybe the rules were off maybe the rules were off so let's do one thing let's do activity number two and if you know why we only returned 12.6% put it in the comments and tell me what you thought of Activity one let's move to activity two this time we'll have an exit strategy and because of this we'll be able to hold on to our winners and exit the losers that should beat the index let's keep all the rules the same we'll have the same universe the same category we'll select the top three mutual funds every single year on the basis of returns but we should exit the losers now I want you to imagine certain funds are performing very well but let's say two funds actually fall and don't do well it drags the entire portfolio down so what if in case number two we can get rid of these bad performing mutual funds and hold on to the winners after all all the great investors have said cut your losers hold on to Winners so let's add a rule how about as soon as the ranking of some of our selections goes below the top 40 so it becomes 41 or 42 or more we exit that mutual fund remember if the returns are low we should exit them in this case study so let's add this as a rule and because of this exit strategy now it seems like the returns should be slightly better right so let's see the results I have it right here drum roll please the returns are as staggering 12.9% I want you to think about this a little bit despite holding on to the best mutual fund winners the top three over a period of time and exiting the ones which were giving a loss which did not perform very well we still made only 12.9% and after doing all of this compare that to Nifty cagr there is hardly any difference so one thing's for sure mutual funds are subject to Market Risk please read the offer document carefully because past returns are not indicative of future performance so to clear if a mutual fund has performed well in the past it does not mean it'll continue to be a winner the answer is this is not the metric to look at when you select a mutual fund so what were the reasons for activity number two to not do well well the first reason is in many cases when we selected a top three mutual fund for the next few years they actually did not do well the returns did not follow up or were equal to that best performing year so overall the returns were reduced the second reason is that a lot of high performing mutual funds in this study tended to have many years of low performance again this dragged the overall performance and the third is a little quantitative but check this out 13 out of the 27 Investments were actually the bottom half of performance in the very next year which means as soon as you selected a good fund on the basis of returns the very next year they formed the bottom half which means they did not perform as well it's very simple and like I said before the metric to choose a mutual fund cannot be returns it does not help in any way to select a mutual fund you know in 2023 the small cap index gave a phenomenal return and when you go back in time it gave another phenomenal return and you go back again it gave another phenomenal return but for the rest of the time it was mediocre people barely even noticed it but nowadays people talk about small cap returns a lot what do you think what's going to happen over the next few years probabilistically is it going to be mediocre or is it going to continue to give fantastic returns for the next 3 4 5 years put it in the comments below okay we understood all of this but how do you actually pick a mutual fund what's the solution so here's what we'll do you can use a quantitative or a qualitative Factor how can we cover all of this in this 10-minute video but I have a special weapon in my hand and it's called the spa report now if we see India's data for one year we can see 83.33% of funds under performed the S&P BC 100 so the question is how can a managed fund by a fund manager not beat a passive fund because there's no management to be done by an index fund index fund is what it's like Nifty or sensex and a mutual fund simply replicates that index and index funds also don't charge that high a management fee because there's not much to manage and this is for large caps the same test by spiva has been done on elss small caps even midcaps so you can check that out over here I'll do one more thing that was just one year data let me open say 5year data you can see in the 5year data 92.86% of funds underperformed the index in other words only 7% of funds actually beat the index this is interesting even on a 10-year period 61% of funds underperformed now as a whole it's probably really tough to pick a mutual fund unless you really understand the market well and can go through all these ratios and make a selection so if you're starting to actually invest in the market the best way to get your hands dirty and get some experience is start a sip and an index fund is a best way to start that there a whole host to actually choose from take your pick start with a small amount and soon later you can add a step up which means add a certain amount every year based on how much your income actually increases this is a great way to get started investing in the market we're also creating this de influencing series by looking at the internet which we call the infinite greed machine which is trying to tempt you into doing greedy stuff like trying to find a way to double your money which actually can't happen or maybe it can who knows and we have an enti playlist called de influencing where we talk about everything from MLM to loan apps check out the entire series and tell us what you think about today's episode as well we drop a new episode every single week see you in the next one le le le Mutual F Le g g best sir

    "transcript_full": "an internal combustion engine and an electric vehicle these are the specifications for these two cars now according to this I'm not sure who will win but let's find out [Applause] [Music] [Music] I'm in the [Music] in that was fun and it looks like the Eevee clearly won I mean they're fun to drive they're fast and of course they win a drag race like this but that's not how EVS are marketed are they they talk about saving the planet and lower tailpipe emissions are they just greenwashing this but what the hell is greenwashing hi Aid welcome to Bangalore sir your namay OTP please [Music] [Applause] [Music] so dude tell me about green washing what what what's green washing so in Kerala all over uh vard it's like a biosphere Reserve it's one of the most ecologically endangered areas in the whole planet yeah and there are people who build these monstrous Resorts which you know like it is horrible right they just clear out Forest chop the mountain and then they build like this L looking Resorts right and then inside the resort you'll have this uh tiny sticker saying we wash our towels only once in 3 days because we will reduce the environmental footprint this is like a classic example of green watching you're like destroying the basically you're saving money dude but at least be open about it right but so if you're really caring about the environment don't build resorts in Forest right but that you this is a way to appear that you're environmentally conscious when you're actually not net net you're not yeah I think uh if you look at like the cans right we drink soda out of whatever it has 100% recyclable written on it I don't think that's true I don't think so or like the pizza boxes yeah yeah just my God it says 100% recyclable but if there's oil on it or something which it'll get cuz there's Pizza in it um so all of this is green washing I think so I think so they're just appearing to be environmentally conscious so that they can appeal to you yep yep and so it's basically marketing right yeah it's a perverse form of marketing but what about EES right like I mean I mean is there something similar happening in E too cuz think about the marketing of EES okay and you're a Motorhead so EES are good for the environment you are doing you're saving the planet if you're driving zero tailpipe emissions uh pollution in cities reduce so Abid uh what are some good things about EES okay so here's the thing right when long time back when EES came the the people who are on the internal combustion engine side they had a lot of good things going on the performance was no match now I have realized that look the performance battle is gone right I mean let's face it right E's purely on matters of acceleration speed Etc EVS are right now gaining the upper hand so the BMW M5 right if you are into cars is like an iconic of what a car should be right and of performance it's it's like the Pinnacle of Auto I it's a fastest Saloon uh car in the world etc etc so it it means a lot to people who are really into uh highspeed cars right or high performance cars so there was a recent video where a Tesla Model S uh did a race with M5 on a standing start right and there was no match right Tesla easily won yeah which was okay I get it right because he electric can accelerate faster from zero etc etc the problem was next they did another race in which M5 had a rolling start so M5 was speeding up to 100 K mph and at the start line where Tesla standing Tesla now tries to catch up with it right and it doesn't it doesn't dude is all of this just marketing just like it's it's like very distress I tell you why that scene made me so sad there's only one incident in my entire life when I was that sad before and that is the scene where Lion King May Mufasa gets killed by you know that that you have to understand the emotion of that moment so it's it's gone the performance battle is gone EVS are going to accelerate faster they are going to throw up more HPS one is performance performance is incredible no questions there's also obviously the less pollution no uh tailpipe emissions uh no noise pollution and if you're into maintaining this for a long time EVS obviously cost less to run because of you know the costs are lower but there's something about this it feel so good right like think about all the charging St we see they are blue and green yeah there's some marketing happening over here's a lot ofke yeah yeah [Music] yeah so what came first the chicken or the egg see HH okay Eevee or uh the IC which came first so I know this is the Eevee but I'm going to pretend I don't know this what came first the chicken or the egg I mean what came first the electric motor or the internal combustion engine it was actually electric vehicles and to know this roller coaster of a story let's go back to the black and white days of the 19th century back in the 1830s Scotland's Robert Anderson created a motorized Carriage with non-rechargeable batteries a discovery that made people drop their jaws look a carriage that moves without horse how Splendid but because the batteries were non-rechargeable the buzz around the electric carriages soon went bust however 20 years later with the invention of rechargeable batteries a future of Eevees was dreamt again scientists across the world were Fast and Furious to build the best EVS that ever existed well that didn't really happen but in 1894 the world saw its first commercial electric car the electr bat and since then eeve became an instant hit however eeve had one sneaky competitor the internal combustion engine or commonly known as petrol K but these petrol cars were well terrible they were constant noise machines emitted tons of toxic fumes and most importantly required intense and risky hand cranking to start so by the early 1900 s over 13 of all cars were electric while only 22% were IC powered and the remaining 40% were steam engine cars which like Ross Gill's marriage didn't age well we were on a break however with the advancement of IC cars and their lucrative prices these cars ate up the entire Market of electric cars and dominated the car industry for the next 100 years making EES obsolete but in 2008 Tesla bought out a banger the Tesla Roadster this insanely fast sexy looking longlasting on mileage car flipped the perspective of eeve and while car manufacturers around the world were becoming environmentally conscious governments were focused on forcing them to reduce emissions the Tesla Roadster laid a stepping stone for Ev development since then almost all car manufacturers have started Crea in EES because Eevees are set to play the Uno reverse card on Ice card so we've talked about the good things about Eevee maybe now it's good to talk about the bad stuff okay the first is probably like how much they cost right they cost a lot more like what 40% more they are significantly more expensive than uh their IC counterparts and there are subsidies bringing them cheaper but I mean if there were no subsidies they were way more expensive than petrol and the interesting stats here is if you look at generally who are the people who are buying uh EVS it's not the middle class or the lower middle class who's buying EVS you can easily see that there's a bias towards richer people who are buying EES so I mean they are expensive there's no tell me this right like because they're expensive does it drive into the social status game that they Eevee to I'm saving the planet but you know to expensive be has so it's playing to that so that's one second is probably range anxiety I mean before that see you I think you probably have to take one step before the range anxiety right because range anxiety is there but where is it coming from it's fundamentally the lack of EV infrastructure in the sense that if if I were to like a friend of mine right somebody in my team wanted to buy an eeve he wanted to buy an Exon and he lives in Chennai I'm like use case what's your use case he's like I want to go visit my parents every weekend dude listen where are you going to charge this thing and see the thing is this right Chennai I think from Bangalore is around I 400 K I mean coric Cod is uh 3 300 OD km my hometown and I know that unless I'm on a full charge I'm pushing the edge of I'm just going to break but it's not even that right like the places where you can do eveve parking and charging one it'll take too much time two a normal car is already parked there and very few of them exist very few exist I think I saw my friend also has a Tata uh car which is Eevee he was trying to plug it in it didn't work yeah it won't work a lot of things won't work and the problem is not also that right even even if you are charging compared to Europe which has fast Chargers India doesn't have fast too many fast charges what's the difference like in speed I think it's about the the voltage is twice or Thrice there compared to here and I think uh this the speed of charging could be 2 to 3x or even more no no no in minutes cuz it takes me like 4 minutes to charge to like fill up my petrol car yeah yeah I think it's going to take you maybe 45 minutes on a bad enough charger dude what a trip that is that's not nice unless you can really time perfectly at lunch time you stop here correct put it on charge have lunch and hope that the charger and hope that the charger works and because you won't know till you actually come back and oh wait it's kind of scary man actually what if what if I cannot charge it correct and what if you're with your family correct like it's kind of scary what if you're in the middle of bandipur there's like an elephant chasing you oh so yeah that that problem is uh you can't help it and and also that that brings into question the the the whole thing of range right so the range figures which you see in EVS have like a catch because the range figures that are disclosed by AR in India is done on a AC room in a rolling bar where eeve is standing stationary and you're like and you're 500 km no tell me this what's the problem with an AC room is there a connection between battery and uh heat yes so that's the catch so even if you take a normal battery I take a normal a a AA battery or something heat it up a little bit and try to use it its life will be lower so heat and Battery don't same with your phone right like it's lithium it's a lithium iron battery so generally electronic stuff and heat don't go well together like earlier when we were in the car GoPro camera overheated I don't know what's the exact mechanism but these these guys don't like each other if you're going through Gujarat to Rajasthan to some really yeah hot place yeah your range will be way lower on a day way lower lower so if I expected 200 km it could be 120 but all the guys buying really sexy looking EES okay I'm not saying like bad looking EES don't talk about this dude they say look I went fast and they have these photos and they're like saving the planet so so here's the thing right that that initial acceleration responsiveness is something Everyone likes it's very difficult that's dopamine right but it is cool it is cool there's no doubt about it there's no doubt about that everybody loves a car that wakes up the moment you press it right half the reason why people love these hyper tuned tiny cars with high power low power yeah it's a boom you can't escape the boom so difficult to escape it but at the end of the day I'm not sure if everybody who's buying an Eevee has really thought through all the problems of battery life and also there is a question of what do you do with the battery after it's over what do you do I have no you you can't do so so here's the problem right the other car petrol car has an internal combustion engine yeah Eevee has internal combustion now you might be wondering where is this come from have you heard of internal combustion in Eevee no I'm I'm a little lost so basically if you keep the battery and pour some water on it this was a joke oh God oh my God it it'll burn right and here's the catch if I'm not mistaken this is not a fire you can put out with water because hey it was costed by water it's short circuiting the battery and which also means that you can't really throw away the battery easily either because if you just throw it away and if what happens to this what's the short circuit water causes a short circuit and it just burns but what do you do after the battery is done like this is not recyclable so I really don't know what what happens to the battery in our phones after you throw it away I have no idea eeve still get a very green and clean image due to their lower tailpipe emissions and the average EV owner thinks that he's saving the planet but that may not show the complete picture to understand everything behind the scenes let's start with the basics take a look at this that was lithium and you saw how reactive that was with water and that is the metal that runs our EV batteries now there are multiple such Metals used and each of them have specific problems but before going there let's quickly look at the general problems with all these Metals most metals required for E are generally rare earth metals which are scarcely available let me give you an example only India's fossil fuel Reserve is about 660 million metric tons this is just for India and not the world compare this to the total lithium reserves of the world which are about 26 million tons therefore unless Battery tech completely changes and innovates using renewable or abundant sources the very first problem we face is that we don't have enough lithium Reserve scarcity let's move on to problem number two water consumption to extract one ton of lithium it requires five lack liters of water and can result the poisoning of reservoirs and related health issues now let's move to problem number three energy consumption the process of extraction of these Metals involves external heat supply for quicker and higher yields this makes this process super high energy consuming and that energy comes from fossil fuels LOL then we have problem number four toxic waste chemicals like sulfuric acid and sodium hydroxide used in the extraction process can penetrate the soil and water and I've not even mentioned the weak regulation or worker exploitation yet another key issue is forest fires sorry I mean landfill fires so how is that a key issue imagine EV batteries that are thrown away in these huge landfills what would happen to those batteries during rainfall they would instantly go up in flames right and they could cause fires for a long long time and guess what this is already quite common in 2022 major cities faced huge fires and landfills that didn't last hours not even days it lasted months now the question is who's responsible for the pollution caused by such fires is it the manufacturers is it the government or is it our fault the consumer who thought EVS are sexy if you've liked the episode so far hit that like And subscribe and don't forget to comment if you give enough time Abid infrastructure will improve the quality of the battery will improve maybe the plugs will start working the apps will become smooth it's a matter of time right point it is going to be nice but you cannot but you have to admit that you're saving the baby seal the polar bear on that Iceberg baby the baby Callas right you are saving the environment with EES or is it go ahead shoot okay so here's the thing right so when you really drill down to it right vehicular pollution gives only around 15% of overall pollution in the world 15% now again you have to look it in perspective because when you say Vehicles it's not not like we are only talking about cars cars what are we talking about we are talking about aircrafts right aircrafts we are talking about trains buses ships OD so if you take out the planes the trains the ships the trucks all the cars put together yes it is maybe 50 60 70% of the but again right it's not so when you it's not so significant at the planet changes so you're already looking at 7% even if you assume vehicles are contributing 70% of that 15% I think fact of the matter is this if you walk to anyone out on the street and say dude this guy drives an Eevee is he doing better than the guy driving a BMW unanimously everyone say of course the eeve has zero emissions correct and it's doing a better job but statistically emissions are a small part no one looks at that in this perspective right the story has been told so beautifully that if you drive this you're saving the planet you're doing something good that's why you get the smug look and it's only 15% of the entire emission so now we have kind of proven that the emissions alone per se is not the problem the real problem comes in the process that manufactures a vehicle and for that I think rather than you and me explaining it out it's better if you see it on a screen with the nice stuff yeah we're talking about the materials like zinc like zinc Cobalt nickel and here it is lithium the EV manufacturing supply chain is messed up I mean mining refining creating the battery cell assembling the battery pack manufacturing the EV o that's a long tiring process so we thought why don't we create an EV for ourselves but to make it we will need to gather different ingredients from around the globe starting with the first and most important lithium disclaimer making e is subject to environmental risk save the planet Earth carefully our thrilling Expedition starts here in the lithium triangle made of Chile Bolivia and Argentina over 50% of the world's lithium comes from this salty water called Brine and by evaporating the brine we get our lithium salt and guess what the amount of lithium needed for one EV battery requires evaporation of 3,700 L of Brine and often times the heat for the evaporation is provided by fossil fuels hm I wonder if that's a problem for the environment anyway we need to process the impure lithium salt which requires fresh water lot of water but since this lithium triangle is in a desert area the lithium mining on top of the already limited water supply has become a big problem for the locals but it's okay we've got our valuable lithium right it tradeoff now we need the next ingredient nickel from the Indonesian rainforests thankfully in Indonesia nickel doesn't require deep mining it helps save costs but there's one teeny tiny problem problem forests nickel ore is found in the rainforest and we need to clear that Forest to get the ore then to extract the nickel from its ore we need to put it under high temperature the heat for which you know comes from fossil fuels but let's brush that aside and we've got another ingredient for our battery now let's go and extract the third most important metal Cobalt over 70% of cobalt comes from one African country the Democratic Republic of Congo Cobalt mining here has exploded since the 2000 mostly driven by Chinese Investments but the problem is that up to 30% of cobalt comes from unregulated mines where workers work by hand without any protective equipment these mines are prone to collapse and the collapse have been fatal in the past and unfortunately some unregulated mines have also been known for child labor the EES don't seem so green anymore do they but hold on the process isn't over just yet the remaining Metals required to make the battery are extracted from different countries we now need to go to China to refine these metals and these refined Metals go to Korea to become batteries then the batteries go to Germany to become a battery pack and the battery pack goes to the US to be put in an Eevee and finally finally your green Eevee gets imported to India so that was materials and I'm guessing by now we know that the smug guy who driving my Eevee he's probably bloody killing children in Angola for mining his Cobalt or I mean I shouldn't say it to but look at the horror of it right it's absolutely irresponsible supply chain which is going on in the name of mining these aats but yeah but now let's come to the more obvious topic right the the usage so it's mostly like like my question what I am wondering is so where's this electricity coming from that's a really good question think about all electricity your home even that powers this these vehicles that we're traveling in that electricity is actually coming from coal I think what's interesting here is people say zero tailpipe emission yeah they don't say zero emissions they don't say zero emission and the difference is because the electricity okay it's coming from coal I think over there in that value chain if you can remove coal completely and that becomes sun powered solar powered or or some other renewable source or clear there's a different political issue that but if that would happen that would that would change um all of this but that won't only affect electricity in vehicles it might affect electricity in our homes so I have a connected question here so I know for a fact that the average vegan person saves the planet by flying the avocados and almonds they eat halfway across the world on a flight what's the scene in E it's the same thing dude like if you look at an ice vehicle companies are vertically integrated of course we have the advantage of time over here commercially Vehicles like this have been a success for like what 100 plus years so companies have the mining they have the assembly they have the research all in one place like your car are there like vegans watching this yeah go your car I think was was came from madas Chennai yeah from Chennai so pretty close by right but that's not hours that's cool but that's not true for uh EV Vehicles so we have lithium mind in Australia then almost all of it is refined in China then it goes to Korea to actually become a battery the battery then turns into a battery pack in Austria or Germany and then it goes all the way to the US to become an actual EV vehicle which we then import and say why don't they buy build it in Europe itself that would be interesting but that's not how it's happening right now so two noobs like us sitting on this random white space figured out that environment and the batteries can't be disposed of correct it's a problem of course the eeve guys exactly know this issue correct why are they pushing for reviews just to make money lots and lots of money a lot of money to be made see the thing is this right the world economy kind of works by making people buy more stuff yeah if especially if it's aspirational yeah and even otherwise just make make a so that's the basic that's Bas there's no harm in admitting that look look guys it's also good for the economy because you'll end up spending your money but zoom out a little bit right oil is not just um this import this entire power play of countries have happening over here yeah so that's the thing right see I get it from a European point of view Europe see either Europe legitimately doesn't want to depend on Russia or they have a nice story to sell saying look man no Russian oil let's go to E right but in either case if they are doing this right it's not like so first of all again I don't know how safe their power plants are they have a lot of nuclear going on but I think there is still significant non-nuclear conventional sources happening in Europe so you are exporting the problem somewhere else but then that's what Europeans always do so we get it I mean but the question is this right I don't get the fun of why is in why are Indians so pumped about this because it could be energy Independence for us we import a lot of oil from whom like we have friendly relationship with Russia we still have some dependence um energy wise the alternative is you're going to depend on China for your value chain care like I hope we create some alterate Source within the country no but almost all the electric vehicle resources a Earths everything is cornered by China there's no way you're going to get away with making an Eevee without China get maybe this is where they how they start somewhere but dude I think if someone really wants to save the planet yeah then he should consider not buying new clothes also yeah because some of the most em we're talking about emissions and polluting the planet a lot of the garbage that is actually created in the world is because of clothes yeah yeah that's true and all these mounds and mounds of debris that we see over here it's not a lot of it is not electronic a lot of it is actually clothes yeah textiles are one of the the most polluting Industries and the the within that is fast fashion yes really quickly lots of fashion goes out people buy it and then throw it away to get onto the next Trend so that's why we'll do another perspective episode on Fast fashion if you want to see two dudes who dress like this talk about fashion please join hit that like And subscribe bye-bye",

    "transcript_full": "appraisal for this guy sir I have made 5 lakhs profit look at this you made 5 lakhs profit what I have made you proud trading yes how many trades 25 what's the strategy sir I cut my losers and I hold on to my winners but that's not easy to do you this is what you have taught me no I have made you proud now say yes on camera okay I'm very confused I guess I'm proud of you thank you so from tomorrow I'll start trading with real cash real cash wait what is this yesh I should learn by doing so I'm learning by doing okay so give a round of applause to abishek thank you don't be abishek if but sir what's the problem I mean this is real trade no these are real trades real data real company virtual money but how does it matter it is let's go through all of the trades that abishek made to make a 50% Roi understand why it won't happen in real life yeah I would love to know yes please let's [Music] begin so first tell me why did you even consider doing virtual trading or paper trading okay so I want to test my strategy now so the orders are real the data is real it feels like it's real it's just that money is not real money is not real now if that strategy works there on a real platform only the the the cash is virtual so I can apply that strategy to my real trading account with real money so I'll make money they have gamified trading yes I have one question for you youve played PlayStation huh and uh you've played Need for Speed and all those games Most Wanted you like that game right were you good at it yes which means you could run away from the police in the game go around the county do all these things and you won right you were a good driver right would you drive Papa's car like that I think I have to teach you sir that is a game yes virtual guard huh virtual Poli yes this is not virtu virtual cash only virtual cash and virtual trading strategy is not virtual no so two different things so I think the first thing is virtual cash is not equal to real cash just like any other game this looks like a great game and as a game it's probably okay but it has nothing to do with the real world say sir you are right Absol absolutely virtual cash but the strategy is real now if I apply that strategy in real markets it will work no when you started I can see that you lost about 2 lakh rupees huh is that fine yeah I have 8 lakhs got it and if you lost 2 lakhs in real life you wouldn't be so chill about it you would not be able to make decisions 2 lakh rupes is gone now you're left with only eight if 20% is gone you'd have to earn 25 30% to break even you would be worried sick and there would be another episode because you know he comes to me for stuff like this and I don't think you could have traded after that 8 lakh rupees tell me how many trades did you do after you lost those 2 lakhs so 10 trads and all of them were profitable I can see 1 2 3 4 and this one trade made you three lakh rupes back to work could you have actually held on to a trade for so long in real life I don't think so the the thing with virtual cash is that the the rewards aren't real and the consequences aren't real either so it's teaching you that no matter how much money is lost you don't care yeah but if I'm following a strategy if I follow that strategy in real markets with real money so I'll make that money you know which is the point is very simple when you lose money you'll be really scared and when you make money you'll feel really greedy and that is not felt in Virtual trading if you lose 2 lakh rupees in real life you won't be able to actually follow your strategy because you'll be scared for this point you are right okay agreed right and also if you look at this pyramid actually I have the pyramid right here you'll see that most Traders quit after a certain period of time and most Traders Won't Last a couple of years because the psychological effects of losing money very quickly is crazy how often do you get your salary monthly sir and what if I gave your salary your month salary in a day would that make you feel happy will you no what if I took away away 6 months of your salary by reaching into your bank account and running away with it sub but will you be upset obviously sir why would you so the Cadence of real life is a monthly salary and hard work but the Cadence of trading is lose a lot earn a lot lose a lot earn a lot and that Cadence is something we don't understand and because of that you create a wrong psychological makeup about money and things mess up in real life you won't be able to follow your strategy H okay sir you are right again the strategy did not work I made a loss of 2 lakhs but after that I made a lot of profits no So eventually strategy is working problem about that I am looking at your trade log over here you made these trades yes this is your strategy yes nice you proud of it you taught me sir you've got no I didn't teach you this you've got to see this so so what was the strategy here okay so I bought one lot here and the price went up and I sold it okay and the price went down I can see that the lot is 200 shares and you sold it at 50 PESA 50 PES so 50 PESA profit multiplied by 50 into to 100 rupees which came instantly seconds and this is the strategy yes he up down up down correct then I bought it again then I sold it again then I bought sold bought sold bought sold bought okay there are two problems over here okay the first one is let's suppose this is how much H salary money s continue let's suppose this is how much you earn with your trades so one 2 three four five yeah yeah earned got it this is what you earned with your 50 PESA profit strategy which is really nice but we also have a few other uh charges we have St and we have some Dy and then you have some other cost which I'll explain in a [Music] bit sir this is wrong give my trades back let me show you something so this is a calculator and I'll put 1,000 Buy 1.5 cell right 50 PES 200 quantity as an example and you can see over here we have brokerage then we have STD we have exchange transaction tax we have clearing charge in this case is zero there's some GST there is SE charge there's stamp Duty there's total tax points to break even is here and you can see your net p&l was not the profit you thought you have actually lost because transaction [Music] cost and all of this is not a secret so that's the first problem paper trading may not account for all these real life costs and then there's something called slippage you know what slippage is huh you know what you exit the trade if you do there's some split seconds of exitment you do and so basically you're trying to enter at th000 and exit at 10005 but you may not get 1,000 entry you may get 1000.1 yes and you may not get 1.5 exit you may get 1.45 your margin of profit reduces um because you don't get the executed price you thought you would so execution is also an issue so understood this is this surprising this is of course you are again right okay okay this one more thing over here I can see that is to you predicted you'll make 100 rupees and you did but you said 5 lakh rupees how did that happen was it the same strategy yes it was same I just increased the quantity to 20x this looks like 50x but you took a lot of Leverage to earn that 50 PESA now what if you went for a te bre and you came back and the market fell like 5 10 Rupees you would have lost half your Capital no you're taking way too much risk cash it's the wrong strategy I say exactly but didn't you feel good when you made that 5 lakh rupees I and if we rewind this episode you said I will make 5 lakh rupes in 25 trades correct correct correct correct correct you are right again yes you are learning or you're being you're having positive reinforcement for bad habit okay so there are a bunch of problems over here you don't know the risk tolerance of these guys for example the person over here may be investing or trading with one tenth of his total capital or 100th of his total capital and you might trade with your entire Capital 100% so your risk is different second even he is not scared of losing any money he's freaking gambling he's playing a game and this is not back tested it's not a real strategy you basically have a bunch of sectors you roll the dice if one of them do well it shows up as 1,000% these are just tips it's like an organized tips Market I guess because you're trying to copy someone else and that never works are okay sir what should I do what's the checklist of course we have a checklist so I'm not saying you should not do paper trading let's make a checklist if you do paper trading here's how you should do it fair okay one make sure you're doing paper trading and know that it's not real trading that's a fairly simple one psychologically psychologically you should know it's not real second make sure you don't take crazy amounts of risk if you are going to take 1 or 2% risk per trade in real life repeat that in Virtual trading I should think that is my real money as virtual money yeah you can't take it's easy to take 10x leverage 20x leverage when you're virtual trading cuz it's fun don't do it if you plan to use it as a simulator to learn trading psychological point2 that's true the third one is stay away from leaderboards badges nudges gamified versions of paper trading because paper trading is supposed to simulate whether you can take decisions or not it's not supposed to gamify the experience imagine a nud saying Nike fell 5% yesterday if you had shorted with 10x leverage you would have earned $5,000 this nudge is completely meaningless it makes no sense how would you have known Nike would have fallen Etc so any nudge that you get inside a paper trading app is not useful because it's spoiling your psychology and fourth because it's a game people tend to trade a lot take multiple trades in the first half of the day multiple trade second half of the day this is also called over trading trading way too much one human mind cannot take so many decisions right second you you're doing so many trades it adds up on all the costs so if you go to a calculator you can see all the costs are compounding oh like the one you have showed earlier yeah it's negative right like we've heard about compounding this is the opposite you're adding costs perfect sir I got the checklist I'll just make another portfolio oh sir I have another another the scheme sir yeah okay you do the f I got to go now I think we're done just listen to this sir you should like And subscribe sir [Laughter] life",

    "transcript_full": "with option trading I have made 20 laks in just 5 days option trading H with just 5,000 rupes I have made lxs it's so simple I'm also going to put in 3 months off my saving into this H this is [Music] interesting are a okay something was definitely wrong with the expectations of that guy do you know option trading is so popular and people think they can make a lot of money but here are the stats nine out of 10 traders in the fno segment actually made losses in fy22 and the average loss was 1.1 lakh rupees and these are not some random stats sebbi says it and if you remove the profitable outliers just 6% of all fno Traders individually made money and the average profit was just 3,400 rupees 3,400 rupees was the average profit what so basically very few people actually make money in options so we'll talk about all the things that seem shiny about options we'll talk about the good we'll talk about the bad cuz certainly the Internet isn't telling you the truth so let's get started so before we understand why people lose money in option trading let's quickly understand what derivatives are if you already understand this you can skip ahead if you don't know what it is we'll do a quick understanding of what and how they work so just like you can buy and sell shares in the cash Market you can also trade in the derivatives Market with Futures and options a derivative is exactly how the name sounds you derive the prices from something else like the prices of Cur and butter can be derived from the prices of milk so if the prices of milk go up of course the prices of CD and butter will also go up because that's the raw material needed to build this item it's a derivative similarly the derivative Market is derived from an underline usually stocks and shares so here's an official definition of an option contract an options contract is a financial agreement that grants the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a underlying the underlying could be stock or share or something else at a preset price within a given period so infosis option contract derives its value from infus shares and like that famous movie dialogue let's explain with a simple example so let's imagine you want to buy a cycle you know the simple tining the cycle you go into a shop and he says if you want to buy it please pay me cash right now you say sir I don't have the money right now but what I can do I can give you 1,000 rupes up front to block this particular cycle cuz I like this design and in 10 days time I will come and I'll pay the rest and the cycle is 10,000 rupees by paying the 1,000 rupees let's call it the premium you were able to block and say that I have the right to buy this cycle for 10,000 rupees within the next 10 days now notice the cycle is the underlying 10,000 rupees is the strike price or the price that you want to buy and 10 days is the time limit or the expiry date within which you can complete your obligation now the reason that he paid 1,000 rupees upfront and not the entire 10,000 rupees is because he's a little unsure he's a little unsure whether he'll actually ride the bicycle and he really needs it he wants to think about it and he's also unsure of the price in fact he's speculating that the price of this cycle may go up or down for multiple reasons now two things can happen you can either come before the 10 days pay the rest and and take the cycle or you come back after 10 days what do you think is going to happen do you think that the owner is going to sell you the cycle after deducting that 1,000 Advance you gave to him what's likely going to happen You've Lost That 1,000 rupees because you did not complete the contract you said you'll come back in 10 days and buy the cycle but you didn't so he will not honor it and that 1,000 rupees is gone now can someone force you to buy the cycle no you've bought the right it's not an obligation if you don't want to buy it don't but if you don't then at 1,000 rupees it's gone now of course options isn't that easy there are other aspects to this as well this particular example is a call option where you're saying that you want to buy this stock or in this case the cycle within a particular time in the stock market you can do the opposite too you can also buy a foot option where you think the price of the underlying of the stock is going to fall so now here is the thing you have a bunch of variables here first you have Direction whether you think the price of the underlying is going to go up or down second you have the token amount that you're paying for that's the premium this moves as well then you have the expiry date this entire contract expires at a certain time in the future by adding all these variables the prediction of the prices becomes really tough especially when it's within a time limit this makes option Trading really really complicated and difficult but despite this option trading is on a rise people love trading options because money can seem like it'll come quickly and it's just it's just exciting and that's the Jud of the entire problem in fact people love options so much 400 times more option contracts are traded than actual cash market and if you look at this you'll see people are trading options way more versus is any other country but why is this let me show you one thing which will blow your mind this is Asian pains and I can see that Asian pains has risen in This Time by about 3% if you had invested 1 lakh rupes you would have made 3,000 this is how a normal investor would think about 3% as a return but the same time frame if someone had taken a call option it would have gone up by 137% now you tell me someone who's never traded in the market who has no idea how the stock market Works has never invested finds out that one stock went up 3% and the same stock in the derivatives Market went up 137% in the same time period which is what one day he'd think let me start trading and figure out how options work let me make this example a little more exciting this 137% and all sounds interesting but in real cash what does that mean so if in derivatives Market you can't just buy one share you have to buy a certain number of shares that minimum number of shares is called a lot now I can see that Asian pains is a minimum of 200 shares but you know in the derivatives Market it's not trading at thousands of rupees like the cash Market it's actually trading at 29 rupees for this example so 29 rupes multiplied by 200 you would have paid 5,800 Rupees to make this one one trade and this 5,800 rupes would have given you a 137 profit theoretically this is what beginners think it's a low investment cost and it seems like you can double your money very easily so a small Capital lots of volatility and in a small time frame you can double your money it feels and this is the second point the barrier to entry is really low if you look at any option contract that you're looking to buy um I mean it costs 1 rupe 10 rupes 20 rupes 30 rupes and it feels like it's easy let's see if I can make 20% Which comes to the third Point influencers sometimes these people mention specific products to make you transact in them sometimes they think it's a good idea sometimes they get a commission through an affiliate link but whatever the reason is a lot of these people were also in options and in options the thumbnails were crazy when you see a thumbnail like this which says 5 lakh rupees in 5 minutes you might click because you're curious you might watch a few minutes because it's entertaining you might watch the next video because you really want to understand how we made 5 lakh rupees in 5 minutes and if someone can actually do that why aren't they rivaling aani and then we have the Advent of the internet over the last few years opening an account with a broker has become really easy access has has become really easy so anyone who's not even read or seen this Channel or read Varsity or done anything to understand how markets work can just trade and that is the definition of gambling and because of all of these reasons we've gone from 7 lakh traders to 45 lakh traders in a really short period of time and in fact I can see here that over 85 billion option trades were placed in India that's 83% of Global option trades take a moment to realize how much that is 80% of the number of option trades happen in India that's a problem because I don't think most of these people understand how option works and most of them are gambling but you know what's the most interesting thing out of all these facts it's this 89% of option Traders lose money and this is not me or our research team saying this sebbi said this so why do people lose money now in this I'll only explain about buying an option we're not going to talk about writing an option or selling an option because it might get a little complicated because this video is for absolute beginners so the first thing is limited time let's say we take two trades one is where we buy a stock and let's see what happens to the stock and second is we buy a call option we are bullish on it in the option Market this stock didn't move at all for the next 3 days look at that it's barely moved okay this means whatever you invest is lugbug the same let's look at our call options of the same underlying because the stock didn't move well the options also should not have moved right but as you can see it's Fallen more than 15% now you tell me why did the option fall 15% if the market didn't move only what happened this is called Theta or time Decay basically the option contract has an expiry date and as you go closer and closer to the expire day the value becomes closer to zero so this adds a new dimension not only do you have to predict the direction of the price you also have to predict how fast it'll go you also have the option premium well now you also have time you have to predict when this will happen it has to happen sooner and predicting that it's kind of difficult the second reason is just plain lack of knowledge there was this survey over here where the survey said 40% people enter you know because they think they can double their money quicker now when you start trading you could lose money or make some money so let me tell you some two interesting stories we found here is a story of one guy who started trading with a capital of 2 lakh rupees and he says you make a few wins then you realize it's quick money then you go all in and one day I lost 1 lakh rupees clearly this person hadn't spent any time understanding how the option Market Works he just went in to make some quick money thought of it it is gambling and this is what happened another story on Reddit is even more interesting he first made 5,000 rupees then made 20,000 rupees in 5 minutes and thought this is not that tough I can figure it out and eventually he lost 59,000 rupees in just a few hours and as soon as this happens something interesting occurs in your brain your brain tells you and intellectualize it saying if you spent a few minutes to earn money you lost money it's part of the game you'll find a way to make back that loss and then get back in the game and then you start trading a little more aggressively this my friends is called Revenge trading you probably don't know this because you're not in the cycle but anyone who has should tell their story in the comments if you have lost money in fno without understanding how it works please tell us your story and let the Z1 Community understand what are the pitfalls and psychological tricks you tell your mind and lose cash for no reason and I think all of these Behavior your turns into addiction right Revenge trading I want to trade again I'll find a new strategy I watch YouTube videos I do all these things and I'll feel like taking one more trade and it becomes well an addiction and that's a problem and we have the perfect story here as well here we can see that someone says after losing 1.8 lakh in options I told myself I'll stop but I did it again this is a definition of addiction the fourth point is wrong influence imagine someone watching a YouTube YouTube video and then trading I mean right I mean who watches YouTube videos and then starts trading I mean can you imagine someone taking a large portion of their salary and actually putting it to options of course this is true and that's why this is a point over here we found this really interesting story of someone who bet half of his entire salary in option trading and lost it all here he says the lessons I learned is that if something is too good to be true it definitely is and here it says 36% of option Traders are under 30 and you know they have this for more of the market and they want to make that money quick and we also know that 37% of people spend their trading Capital after getting influenced by social media the guys on the internet don't really care about your Capital they care about their own stuff so don't listen to them it's weird I'm saying this when I'm talking to you on a social media platform but well I'm de influencing it so say 01 rocks if you thought this was a nice episode please say something in the comments we're trying to make videos which appeal to a larger audience which are simply understood without getting too technical so we thought there should be some series de influencing all of it so let me know what other episodes we can do see you in the next one and if someone can actually do that why aren't they rivaling Amani right why anyway let me explain with a simple answer let me explain with a simple I was doing it for effect",

    "transcript_full": "Who is it? Yes, Prateek sir! Sir, you have to take a right from that tractor & not left!. Nahi. Right. Take a right. Hello? Abhishek. Why have you called me here, man? What are you doing? Farming? Yes. I am working. Why? I want to be rich. You have such a nice job. What's the problem? Sir? What? Come here. So you have asked me to invest all my hard earned money in the markets when my portfolio grows big. Sorry, sorry, sorry. Big. I'll sell it. Right? And after that I'll pay everything in tax and I'll have nothing. So I'll do this. There is no tax on the income from agriculture. And I'll buy this land. I'll just. You decided to become a farmer? Yes! What? Okay, look, I understand taxes you may think are high. But what if I told you if you invested, let's say five lakh rupees. And over a period of time you have to pay a certain amount of tax. Let's say around one lakh. If you did tax harvesting you'll actually pay Rs. 9000. 1 lakh v/s Rs. 9000? Yeah! How? How? But you promise if I tell you, you'll stop this? Yeah. Yeah. Done. Done. All done. I'll just go and change now. Not all I have to do. I'll change. In this episode we're going to talk about how you can actually save tax by doing something called tax harvesting. And I'll even give you a calculator so you can find out what it makes sense for you. So let's begin. Yes, sir. What harvesting? Harvesting are we talking about today? Tax harvesting. Let me explain how this works. So basically, until 2018 there was no tax on long term holdings. So if you held a mutual fund or stocks for more than a year you paid zero tax. Then it became 10%. And recently, now it's changed to 12.5%. So the tax is increasing. Correct. And then you have short term capital gains which was 15% and is now 20%. Now if you are holding stocks for a long period of time, more than a year the government gives you this option called tax harvesting. What tax harvesting is, is you have an investment. The investment grows. Assuming you've held it for more than a year you sell that investment and immediately reinvest it. So let's take an example. You invested in stocks on a mutual fund. Five lakhs. The amount grows after one year. You sell it and you've made a gain. Let's say the gain is Rs 50,000 example. Fair. And then you immediately reinvest that back into stocks. Now what just happened was you're still invested. You didn't really exit but you realize the gains. But that Rs 50,000 gain or whatever. That gain is not included in your taxable gain tax. So you don't have to pay any tax. How long? Up to Rs. 1.25 lakh. And above that? You have to pay. Sir. Concept is clear. Now show me the calculator. So the calculator is. Give me the calculator. Hey guys. So we launched two new channels. Zero1 Women and Zero1 hindi. Do check that out. And now back to the episode. Yes please. Cool. So this is very simple. This is a lump sum calculator. How much? So we have year one all the way to year ten. The investment is five lakh rupees. It is initial amount? Yeah. Okay. And we are assuming, it is growing at 12%. CAGR. Where did you invest? Sorry, sorry. Yes. Growing at 12%. 12% year on year. Now at the end of the 10th year we assume that you sell and you pay a certain amount of tax. That tax is actually over here you can see taxable gain is Rs. 9.27 lakhs. If you calculate the 12.5% of that value, it's Rs 1.15 lakhs. Did you understand? Now what if you sold every single year and invested and reinvested it and took that advantage of not paying tax up to Rs 1.25 lakhs from the gains. Fair! So first year, what's your tax? Zero. Second year. Zero. Zero. Keep going, keep going, keep going. It's only in year nine or year eight where it becomes 955. Now remember, actual stock market returns are not linear like this. This is just an example. And you paid Rs. 9000. So there is a difference. Now is it worth your effort? You need to put in your own money over here and see if it's worth your effort or not. Go to file, make a copy, make the changes and see whether it's working or not. Oh, I have a very interesting question. Okay. So this was for someone who is investing lump sum in the markets, right? Yeah. I was following your index fund plan now. Yes. So I had planned the SIPs there. Same thing. No, Sip is the same thing. What? How is that possible? Tell me how should I understand? I am not able to understand. Everything is the same except in SIP you are. Oh, I see the problem here. Okay. So you're investing every month and you have to make sure when you sell you're selling only the units you've sold which are at least 365 days. Plus. So you have to manually check that? Keep a track of it. But Zero1 is very nice. So we obviously have a? Calculator. Correct. So let's see the calculator. You have to basically keep track every time you are purchasing. So we have date of purchase January 2024. February, March, April, May, June, all the months. Then we have the SIP amount, Rs 10,000. In this case you can change this number. This is still 360. Okay. lYeah. Then you have fund Nav. This is whenever you are buying it, you are buying a get your units. What do you call? Fund NAV! Yes, fund NAV. Yes, sir. So I put 50,52,55,56,57 this is very optimistic. Usually fund NAVs will not keep going up. Then units purchased. Basically then you have date of redemption. Now you don't have to write this. I'll change this January 2025 to 60. 60 what? Oh, NAV. And we bought it at 50 exactly 365 days ago. Okay. One year, 365 days. No, 365 days. Yes sir. Yes. And over here I can see the redemption amount. It gives me the amount to sell. 11,940. So now imagine you did an sip every month, which I'm doing. Also did an SIP December 2024. Okay. Now can you sell those units in January 2025, one month later? Of course I can sell it one year. They supposed to be one year before you can do the tax. I can sell it after one day. That's my money. That's the whole point. Then you'll pay 20% tax on it because that's short term capital gains sell every year. Sir, help me understand one thing. You have said invest for long term, long term, long term. Now you're saying sell every year. Every year. Every year. That's now the compounding works. Make up your mind first. Made up my mind. Okay, let's see. Look at this chart. This chart basically shows you what compounding is. Compounding is staying invested for a long time. Remember when you sell, you are buying the same day. For example, when you are investing in a mutual fund and you sell before 03:00 p.m. then you immediately buy again before 03:00 p.m. you have got the same nav. So technically you are still staying invested which is what the basis of compounding is. I know when I say sell, it sounds like a break in compounding, but that's not true as long as you immediately invest. And obviously you have to make sure you have enough money in the account to make that repurchase. Okay, I have a question. So I have invested five lakhs. And after gains it is Rs 5.6. Now according to you, I should immediately buy that Rs 5.6 because I am sure when I sell it it will take some time for that amount to come back to my account. Correct. So I should have Rs 5.6 lakh in my account? Yeah. To reinvest before 03:00 so you get the same nav and one to two days later You will get that amount anyway from the cycle. How will I get Rs. 5.6Lk? I'm sure you have an emergency fund, you have some savings, you have fixed deposit, you have some liquid cash. Use that. It's just a two days. It's just managing cash flow. Perfect sir, what's the checklist? Okay, the checklist is very simple. We'll keep it quick. First, make sure your investments are more than one year invested. Done. Second, sell the investments to keep the total gains within Rs. 1.25 lakh exemption limit for the long term. Of course, account for brokerage taxes, fees, all that. And make sure or you're still saving money. Otherwise there's no point doing this. So your overall returns will reduce. For SIPs, ensure that you're selling only the units that have completed one year to avoid paying short term capital gains tax. And of course be aware of market conditions. You don't want to sell. Wait for some time. Market closes next day you're repurchasing. A market's up 2%. You don't want that.",

    "transcript_full": "If I were to start my entire investing journey now knowing what I know in 2025, I'm sure it would take me way less time to actually hit my first cr. So, I'm going to explain the blueprint to you. I call it blueprint 1A and blueprint 1B. And I'll also throw in my Google sheet that I actually use for my life today. And once you put all of this together, you might get to your first CR way faster. But you know what? Something happened last week. This is papa. Papa is iron man. 10,000 steps a day, eats well and when he calls me the only thing he says is beta gaja and I feel guilty and I don't go to meet him. He one day called me and said beta I fell down last night while going to the bathroom. I tripped. My shoulder is paining a lot. Of course we were a little worried. Then I thought it's nothing. It'll be fine. I mean and then his pain became worse. So we said okay we'll go to the doctor. The doctor said it's a full tear, you have to get surgery. And we got admitted to the hospital. Just one day, one surgery was 3.5 lakh rupees. And the 3 1/2 lakhs was taken care of by insurance. Now, Swati and I can actually manage a 3 4 5 6 lakh rupees sudden expense and we'll be fine. But if we were younger, this would have been a huge problem. So basically my point is medical insurance is non-negotiable. You have to take it for your family and yourself. End of story. No debate. Then on this Excel sheet, you'll find it in the description. You open and you put your monthly ka pani. Your rent, your expenses, your unexpected expenses. Let's say it's 30,000 rupees. This will be 1 lakh 80,000. This 1.8 lakhs is basically 6 months of air. If something happens, this will keep you safe. You can thank me later. But everything can't be done on an Excel, right? So, I want you to open your favorite note-taking app or a paper and pen like I like it and I want you to write this. Dear mommy, papa, I absolutely love you. And everything I do in this world, my work, my relationships, working hard, earning a salary is for you. If something happens to me, I have made sure that you are safe. Here is my plan mommy papa for the expenses of your health I have made sure I have x rupees saved for you in an insurance I know we have a loan of total 50 lakhs or other things and I have made sure that we have the money saved in case I'm not there you will be able to pay it and you will not be burdened by it with lots and lots of love. Did this scare you? If it did, there is a solution for this and it's called term insurance. It's something to make sure they are actually comfortable and safe. If you have a letter, do let me know what you wrote in the comments if it's not too personal. I'd love to know if this changed your life or not. But the point is very simple here, guys. This was our first step, your safety net. Now, let's move to step number two. You know, last year when we gave appraisals to people in the office, we were so so proud of ourselves. Actually, we just felt really good that people walked away with a decent appraisal and they had more money in the bank now. But then, like always, they completely fooled us. They started buying lot of clothes, expensive ones, went on trips. They even got a new car. The people who had cars upgrade those cars. Then people got nice shoes. And I'm like, at where did all this money come from? Thank you loan apps and easy credit. Point is a lot of people start investing with 500 rupees and that's great but it stays 500 for 5 years. No, the point of starting with 500 is that you begin the process and then you start to increase it as much as possible. This is a simple SIP calculator. On the right side we have SIP amount. Just look at that. Then we have some assumptions. Expected return 10%. Because people in comments go 10% 12%. Then we have invested amount and market value. All you really need to see is this 20,000 when does it become a large amount? You can see over here that it takes 3 years and 6 months to add 10 lakhs to your account. The next 10 lakhs, so total 20 takes 2 years and 7 months. The next 10 lakhs takes 2 years and 1 month. Scroll down towards the end within 11 months you're adding 10 lakhs and even getting to a crudap comments what you'll say you'll say I don't have any money to invest I only have 500 rupees zumato can I have this nice dim sum over here okay I know what the problem is here's a simple hack if you really want to do this as soon as you get your salary look at that salary of that take a 5% or 10% whatever you want to invest and take that money out and invest it This doesn't really need to be stocks. And then what's left? That is where you do your ka. Usually you do the opposite. You call all these apps, make all these purchases and say, I'll also invest to make yourself feel good. Don't do that. And you know what this means? This means we have completed step two of our blueprint. And invest early and invest. I forgot the full form, but you get the point. In my early 20s, I started earning the magical figure of 1.5 lak rupees per month. I felt invincible. I mean, what is this? I earn a lot of money. And something even more interesting happened which I'll show you here. This was my income going up over a period of time. And then something interesting happened. This was my expense. And basically the difference here was my savings. But then when I suddenly thought that I deserved more, this happened and I suddenly started spending more than I could afford. You know what this is called? Economists and some really good noble audience call this unhappiness. also [Music] called whenever you try to spend to signal to the outside world that you have reached some sort of status is the fastest way to become poor. But what's the solution? The solution is the creation of a guiltfree fund. The first x% should go for investments. Then the next for all your fixed expenses and expected expenses. Then whatever's left is your guilt-free fund. This means everything we've covered so far is lifestyle inflation which is step three of our entire journey at the blueprint. And step number four starts with Romesh and Sur. They both love five-star but they also love something else. Both of them have an SIP but Romesh has credit card debt, personal loan and he may also have BNP. Suresh has none of these things. Let's assume they're investing in say Nifty. It'll be between 10% to 12%. Growth and that's growth. But over here the debt bit, this bit is actually anti-compounding for you at 36 to 48%. So whatever is the highest loan category with the most interest, pay that off first. Once that is done, then do SIP. This means step number four is actually complete, which is the loan trap. But the most important part of this entire blueprint is right here. And if you're wondering what this is, this is basically the compounding blueprint, the safety net, the invest E square. And this is the anti-compounding blueprint which covers lifestyle inflation loan trap and the most important thing of all that's something I keep looking at even today and you should too. It took me 20 years to figure this framework out. It's called the DBL framework. And let me explain it to you a little aram. Two years ago, I decided that I had to learn to play the guitar. And to learn to play the guitar was incredibly tough because I had to go back home, get my instructor, and he would spend countless hours with me just learning. And this was 2 hours every day for 2 years. All that sacrifice and these fingers over here will actually show you something interesting and how this will change your life in the DBL framework. 1 2 [Music] 3 I only dreamed it and I made a blueprint for playing my music. But that instructor never came. I never called him, never negotiated, never studied for 2 hours, never practiced. And this was a waste. Just like you. I've been educating for a decade now. And I realize all these frameworks are great, but you won't listen. You won't actually do it. The don't be lazy framework is exactly this. If you don't do it today, your investments will sound exactly like my music. [Applause]",

    "transcript_full": "This is Karan. You're probably wondering why he looks like this. To understand why, let's go back in time. Karan's parents gifted him a brand new phone when he was in class 10. Back then, social media was um social. So, he went on the best app that was possible, Facebook. added all of his friends, poked them, found out what they're doing, commented, liked, did everything all of us did on Facebook, and actually interacted with his friends until one day he got a notification. Diva tagged him on a photo and he was finally cool in his own eyes. When Diva tagged him in that photo, that was the best high he had ever experienced. and he wanted more and more and a little bit more. [Music] Facebook was so popular in India that it was actually the second largest market for Facebook with 10 cr users. They actually cracked the Indian market and then Instagram happened. This was a breath of fresh air. all those pictures. It looked beautiful. I mean, look at that scroll. And the best thing was Karan's parents weren't on it. Instagram launched reals and this changed everything. You see, humans are pleasure seeking creatures and they want a way to satiate their pleasure. So, they have to have a desire and they go out and find a way to actually complete it. But the brain and the body isn't designed for that kind of reward every single day. But social media seriously messes up the brain and you become addicted. The interesting thing about reals is that it creates a social bubble. You can see here Karan was dating this girl and all he saw on his social feed was relationships, dating and how love makes life beautiful. But suddenly one day he broke up with her and all he sees on that feed is toxic relationships, self-help, how you should be solo, how you should enjoy your life and not be dependent on anyone. But why and how has this happened? Here is why. Because apps track everything. These are some popular apps and everything that they track. Purchases, location, contacts, user content, search history, browsing history, usage data of their internet, financial information, etc. But out of the thousand possibilities, let's look at one SMS. Just with this, imagine how much information you can get. You can get all the purchase history, location, where they're going, and you can sum this up to actually create a persona of what this person is. They know more about you than you know you cuz [Music] [Applause] you can see from this report right here that the company's behavioral advertising business, which is its main business, I can see here out of the $55.8 $8 billion it earned 55 billion came from ads. So if they have to monetize your free time they have to do something a little more sinister human psychology. In fact this is how Karan ended up here in the first place. But I'll tell you that a little bit later. Since you've been watching this video a notification is played five times and you probably didn't even notice it. And I'm sure at least once you would have checked your phone and then thought notification or you would have paused this video because you had to check that important message. And this is the first way an app exploits your psychology. The notification. If an app wants your attention, they should have a custom notification sound. But actually they don't. They use the default one that comes with the phone. [Music] And the reason is so it blends in with all the important notifications. Trust me that notification is not urgent but because it blends in with SMS and all the other important notifications you feel like checking and once you check you get something called the variable reward and because of that you crave that dopamine hit again. Now, since the social media apps know what is triggering those dopamine hits, they send you these notifications at random times, the next hack I call the red danger zone hack. You see, humans perceive the color red to be danger. That's why every single notification has a red dot saying this is important. I need your attention. On the other hand, if your family goes to a wedding and they give a red lifa with the money, the shagun, then you know that next time when they come to your family event, they have probably kept a track of how much shagun you had given. And I'm sure your parents or someone elder actually keeps a track of this and tries to reciprocate it the next time they go to their event. This is called social reciprocity. And the same thing is true on social media apps too. When you see 12 unread messages on WhatsApp, you feel like replying to it ASAP. [Music] The next hack is called loss aversion. Think of it like this. The psychological pain of losing something has almost twice more value than something that you can gain of about equal importance. By snap [Music] Minute wait. [Music] He panicked because his friend didn't send him a photo and he would break a streak. To be honest, what a Snapchat streak is, it's people sending photos to each other to maintain this. I asked around office and this is what their streak count was 2000,000 [Music] 1,56 449. So I asked them how much money or badge or what do you get when you get a streak? Like what's the end goal? And they said it's fun. There's no end goal. That's why I think this is a crazy hack. And because of these tactics, Indians on average spend 194 minutes or 3 hours on social media every single day. And you know what's ironic? The owners, the founders of these social media apps themselves publicly say that they prevent their own children from using these apps. Maybe because they understand the consequences. But I'm not just talking about bias. We're also talking about something a little more uh scary. It's how your brain develops. You see, people who are addicted to their phones and can't stop scrolling actually have lower gray matter in their preffrontal cortex. Our cognitive load, our thinking, analytics comes from that side of the brain. So if you don't exercise it like a muscle, it actually doesn't develop. And we've actually proved it. The consequences of mobile fold dependence are horrible. Psychological distress, emotional instability, decreased self-control, reduce work performance. But the scariest out of all of them is isolation. [Music] Now imagine the brain is designed for let's say this level of stimulation. But now with social media you are overstimulated and you're way over here. So when you get bored with any app, you just switch to Snapchat. And then you get bored of that, you switch to Instagram or LinkedIn or something else which gives you that dopamine rush and you always want to stay in that over stimulated stage which is not normal but you have normalized it. In fact 70% of teens who are away from their phones report that they're anxious. That's why when you look at Instagram reels, there's a new feature where even in a 30-second reel, they have a jump ahead. I mean 30 seconds someone can't wait five seconds and they have turned this into a product. But what if this addiction ceases to exist and that becomes the worst nightmare of an addict and it's exactly what happened to Karan when he left his phone at home. [Music] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Oh Please. Please. [Applause] [Music] Woo! [Music] Thank you. [Applause] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Music] [Music] Karan. Karan, honestly, I'm a bit worried about you. And you know, Karan, I know all these videos on the internet are blaming all these companies, but they're not focusing on something. They're all saying it's not in your hand. Addictive, it's not your fault what to do. But they're completely wrong. You actually have the most important part to play in this entire thing. You can decide that you want to focus. You can decide that you want to move your body because that brings you pleasure. You can change the tiny habits that you do. Even getting up early, 15 minutes early a day and doing those five push-ups dramatically changes you from the rest of the population. And those tiny changes actually make a whole lot of difference because if your trajectory was this, it can become something completely different from a tiny change you make today. So promise me if you do these two things and start today, you'll be completely different from everyone else because we aren't helpless. You can get out of autopilot mode if you really really want to.",

    "title_current": "Why we LOSE money in Stock Market?",
    "transcript_full": "sir do you know about this new tech what it's a phone company a phone company now imagine this everyone in the future will have D dude I mean I have a phone right here no it doesn't matter I don't think everyone will have a phone the company will work I've already invested in it oh they have opened three new plants I'll double up my investments now yes hey dude that uh phone tech company you were talking about seems like its market share is declining because iPhone seems like a interesting better product I know I know it is declining see I have invested so much time so much money I still going to invest my money in it but no no logic right I mean the new I know I know it doesn't make sense but I'll still invest [Music] h sir what has happened I'm not surprised this is completely normal what where's your portfolio oh there I see dead dude remember you were investing all your money obsessing over the company going through all of this matter you were emotionally invested in this right and this is called the sunk cost fallacy when you've put in so much effort and money into it that you have to make it a success and because of this you and you will lose money in the markets if you are investing but luckily we thought we'll do an episode on this and try to find out how to identify Sun cost fallacy and how you can actually fix it so let's begin [Music] yes so take a look at this this is the world's first supersonic airplane weird plane it was called Concord it's pretty cool looking and it took flight in 1976 now the interesting thing is it was supersonic you your travel times had reduced people loved it it was owned by the government the British government and the French government and it looked amazing the Press around it was crazy the future was finally here oh in Good Company but it cost billions of dollars of course it will now uh the problem was everything was great but it was not a commercial success and it became clear no matter how many flights they did this cannot be profitable what do you mean by Commercial Success it would not be profitable you would keep sinking in costs into it but still invest so what do you do when you know something is bound to fail commercially we won't invest but the government's actually continued to invest and spend billions of over 26 years on this project you know why no because there was so much energy effort time press money already sunk into this this is called the Concord fallacy right which means you keep putting in money into something or time and effort because you've already put in a lot of cost into it so it's also called the sunken cost fallacy so when you are investing in that company now I have nothing against Nokia I think they've done amazing innovation very interesting but it's one company in your portfolio I'm guessing you did not have a portfolio just had one company because abish and the sunos thing can happen in other things as well like uh what degree do you have oh btech okay perfect btech what are you doing here if you took a btech your job has nothing to do with btech I'll tell you I thought in the start it's good for me I'll do it but by reaching second year I realized it is not my cup of tea it is not my cup of so why did you continue huh because I've spent I mean dad has spent so much money i' I've made friends girlfriends then I thought I should do it so in the second year you knew your career would have nothing to do with bch but you still did it because you spent all that time and effort in the first two years correct so I thought so the fallacy here is that you know that this will not be useful but you've come this far so let's just complete the journey right and that in stocks actually creates losses in real life it could be different but in when it comes to money it could actually result in uh exactly that investment you made so this has also happened to me 2008 there was this IPO of this company okay before the market crashed okay if you can guess in the comments good for you everyone is talking about it taxi drivers Auto drivers and then these rich guys came to me okay the owners of the school where I was working they said should we buy it I said I don't think so and I felt dude everyone's talking about it and then I actually bought those shares then the market fell and so did those shares and I knew it would fall but I had already invested and it's 2023 December yes I am not alone I still own those shares see fundamentally do you think you can pick the right stock every time I don't think so no no one can right like you'll have the stock that I picked that I still hold which will never give me returns you picked Nokia there's nothing wrong with that everyone has these stocks in their portfolio it's normal the problem is not that the problem is the sunk cost fallacy but what's the solution for that then so the solution is very simple let's talk about your investment in Nokia so let's for example think that you were thinking Telecom is the future and everyone will have a phone were you wrong no everyone have holds a phone right now but you made a loss so maybe the first thing you could do is diversify within a sector so let's suppose you think you believe in this you could have bought you could have bought maybe four or five other companies phone companies phone companies one of them could have in Nokia and uh you could have picked the leader second best third best fourth best fifth best one of them would have turned out to become let's suppose Apple so what would have happened is these stocks would have gone to zero let's suppose and this one stock Apple would have actually made all the money for you now were you a genius uh did you see the future that Apple could have become the best phone company in the world no all you did was spread your bets in that sector but there's another problem here you still put all your money in one sector another thing you should do is invest it in maybe s eight other sectors so entire portfolio May there should be one part of phone Communications there should also be Pharma there should also be Auto etc etc etc depending on what your strategy is so that portfolio sector diversification is also important the problem is if you bet everything on one thing uh and then it goes down that cognitive bias is what you want to stay away from so the first thing diversify more and diversify as three parts diversify within a sector diversify in different sectors and what's the third good job diversify in different asset classes I actually made a video on asset classes right here and abishek did not remember asset class I know I know Equity what other asset classes do you have gold real estate yeah mutual fund huh mutual fund andto there's also bonds right so which is fixed income and don't forget fixed deposit in bond correct I have FD good job thank you yeah if this represents your Equity portfolio I put it here then this might represent say uh bonds over here mhm right and then you'll also have that marker which is let's say gold and one more thing bring dice real estate that dice could be say dice dice just one this could be real estate or something else so now what happens is you'll know that every asset has its day in the sun 2008 the equity was doing really well and uh after that it did not do well gold actually probably did better after 2009 2009 Equity started doing well again these are Cycles we cannot predict it helps to diversify within um sectors as well now tell me this what do you think about the future of Eevee Bri bright green green okay and uh would you think that it's worth investing of course it will grow in yes will you invest in one company that no for sure not I'll find try to find at least two to four companies maybe give me a solution what's your solution over here well I'll find four five companies and I'll invest equally in it I think so and then EV portfolio is part of your Equity portfolio which has other uh sectors cool so the first thing we talked about is diversification second thing we talked about is asset classes and the third thing we'll talk about is stop loss good you're you're learning good good thank you so basically you have to have a mental stop- loss for some of this right what stop loss a mental stop- loss for all of this if you're an investor um and write down at what point do you think you'll exit it's really important you know waren Buffett right right people say waren Buffett never sells right people said yes and you'll hold a stock forever right yeah that's what not selling but not but but it's not true he never believed in Airline stocks but at some point he bought I think four or five stocks of Airlines then he realized it's a mistake and then he sold all those stocks at a loss so if van Buffett can think about selling why can't you so you also have to think if for example there is no growth for your EV sector for say four quarters in a row or 2 years in a row I will exit etc etc oh I new alternative comes that's better than eeve I will exit it could also be a price stop loss if it falls more than 75 80% I'll exit sir what if I don't invest in all of this I mean I don't do all of this I just find the best Bond and invest all my money in it it's risk- free um right yeah I mean this goes down to the same thing we talked about um bonds also have risk it is possible that a bond defaults it's possible that a fixed deposit because the bank went bankrupt takes all of your money and is unable to return it so that risk always exists which is why you diversify within asset classes as well so this might not be uh that smart of a thing to do so here's the bottom line you don't want to take one's stock fall in love with it or any asset class and think I'm doubling down and I've done so much I'll do a little more even though I think the situation is grim that's the definition of this bias understand that this bias exists every human goes through it and don't be abish Shake don't get one stock and put everything in it make sure you automate your system make sure you diversify and lastly don't forget to subscribe and like this video and also share right [Music] now sorry guys probably at the interval I knew it's a it's a weird movie again and the third thing we'll talk about is stop stop loss oh yes stoploss asset

    "title_current": "How to buy UNLISTED SHARES",
    "transcript_full": "namaskar Doo and welcome from 0x to 100x today we have a fantastic opportunity called chakachak Eevee you've probably not heard of this company but it has too much Innovation this company is unlisted which means the Normal public does not have access to it and the secret here is in 3 months it's going to go IPO once it IPOs you'll make lots and lots of money so here is how you buy this secret unlisted share which is really exciting step number one what something was clearly wrong with that video I mean unlisted shares it's going to go IPO guaranteed PES I mean is it really that easy a shiny company suddenly going IPO and you getting secret access I mean there must be some risk right so in this episode we're going to learn through case studies about unlisted shares what is really shiny about him and what's dangerous about it we'll talk about the good and the bad cuz clearly the Internet won't tell you both let's begin [Music] in the last one year 75% of all stocks which listed on the exchange actually gave a listing gain which means if you applied for the IPO the chances of you making money was 75% now imagine this is already pretty good but what if you could buy the stocks even before the IPO and multiply that return by buying it when it's in the private Market when only the employees the founders and private investors have invested I mean it's like a inside deal this is the world of unlisted shares you can buy sexy companies for apps you use on your phone your daily life manufacturing EVS you name it and you're buying it when the actual public has no access to it and I think there's another problem when you're applying for an IPO you have to apply for the IPO you may not even get allotment in the unlisted Market you'll actually get the allotment way before the entire IPO thing happens I mean you're getting a secret deal the thing about tech companies and startups which have raised funding and are going to go IPO is that they have growth on their side and this growth of exponential curve you know about this all the gains happen towards the end because exponential growth is happening so the earlier you get in the better and if you can get in even before it IPOs imagine the kinds of gains you can get and I have no idea why other people aren't doing this it sounds like such easy money doesn't it I also think it's really cool all those private Equity players all those VC players can access these sexy companies but you can't because but with the internet and some new platforms we can join that club so how can you invest in these shares well first you can't log into a broking account and actually get it because they're not listed so you have a bunch of ways one if you know the founders you can get it from there you can get it from ESOP holders those are employees where the shares have been allotted to them and you can buy it from them you could also go to some kind of broker who's offering these kind of services to give you access and finally there are some online websites which give you access to these kinds of shares now when you do this transaction remember it's in the gray market so it's not white and regulated but it's not black and illegal it's right in between it's gray now the internet says exactly what I just told you and keep saying the word sexy sexy sexy and keep saying this is cool gives you for more but no one really talks about the risks do they but you know what de influencing does we talk about the risks so put in the comments de influencing Army let's talk about the first risk liquidity risk liquidity basically means let's suppose I pay some money and acquire these shares now once I own these shares that I bought in the gray Market which is unregulated I now am a proud owner of a piece of company that I think is cool the problem here is because there's no Central exchange I can't immediately sell this to someone I'll have to go to a broker or an individual and somehow find a buyer for this it's unorganized excuse me hi excuse me can you can you buy this share excuse me can you buy it's tough finally the biggest liquidity risk is actually the company going IPO you've probably bought this stock thinking that it list they'll be listing gains liquidity H you'll hold on to it or maybe you'll sell it but what if the company never goes public think about it just because a company is doing well doesn't mean it'll IPO just because the promoter said we will IPO doesn't mean they will IPO it is an assumption and not in the hand of the promoter or you and we have an interesting example here if I asked you do you think the future is the metaverse in the next 5 10 15 years what would you say you'd probably say yes in some form we'd probably be living in virtual reality in the future right right so did the investors of J VR joh VR started in 2011 and we can see it raised $60 million before its IPO and they talked about VR content how the future will change but the reality was really different the VR adoption was much slower than expected and because of this the growth projections changed and because they changed everything that the investors thought would be true did not happen valuations did not make sense and they could not IPO which meant a bunch of people were sitting on a piece of paper because the growth never happened and the IPO never happened so assuming just because a company gets funded that it'll IPO perhaps is incorrect the second risk is information or data and I'm not talking about your data I'm talking about the company's data but when you're investing in a private company it's still trying to find product Market fit so you have to analyze all these different parts I think there's another problem as well apart from the scarcity of information there are no analysts fighting out on reports of this industry and the company to tell you the risks involved so if you don't have really intelligent anal s researching this how will you come to a consensus whether the company is good or not usually People Like Us aren't smart enough to figure this out but a consensus system where many people are analyzing in public market scenario actually works out really well so basically the problem is private company information private how will you analyze whether the company is doing well or not there's actually a really good example called tyrannos tyrannos was run by Elizabeth Holmes and she said that they have a new technology that can revolutionize blood testing their company said they have a technology which can do the same diagnostic tests with just a small little V now this was revolutionary imagine how many people would be able to find out their tests faster with less hassle at more locations and maybe in the future at a lesser cost now I want you to imagine with such a technology what would the IPO do well in this case the IPO never happened they found out that the technology ology never really existed and everything was a work in progress a lot of the test results were actually faked and done with original just normal way of doing Diagnostics so the technology didn't exist everything was a farce all she always said was the technology is private I cannot reveal how it works and all the investors who invested held on to a piece of paper which is worth nothing then we have the third risk valuation risk so let me explain this very simply in a private company you have a bunch of guys or investors deciding the valuation of the stock now I'm not saying they could be wrong but it's unlikely they will actually give a fair valuation compared to an entire market so in an unlisted scenario when you're buying shares the price is determined by the founders SL investors and other people involved not Market forces Market forces are when they are on the stock market and many people are trading it trying to value the stock which is why it moves around so much a really good example is reliance retail now people bought the stock in the unlisted market for a certain price and then Reliance retail basically said the new price of the stock is going to be X and everyone who bought the unlisted stocks basically lost a lot of money through this decision now did Reliance retail do something wrong absolutely not they are a private company and can value their own shares based on how pessimistic or optimistic they are and what's good for their company that is your risk and that's why this is called valuation risk and then we have the fourth risk regulatory risk so seevi does a bunch of stuff to actually protect the retail investor now all of these things are only applicable once the company's public in a private scenario the unlisted shares none of these protection systems are actually there I think every investment you look at you have to see from the perspective of risk and a great way to understand this is to assume that if government bonds are the highest secure investment out there relative to other Investments and the most risky is probably let's say cryptocurrency you should always prefer to invest top down so you allocate more here and you allocate the least here now usually you will not have enough money left to go down the highly risky route of unlisted shares private Angel Investing Etc because you have such interesting options up top you have bonds and maybe you don't want to invest in highly risky stuff like unlisted shares Angel Investing in startups or maybe like cryptocurrency the preference of order is always sa first and then move down the highly risky route last so I think this is where psychology comes in you have this hero fallacy think about it if I tell you that a doctor is a hero sitting down listening to his patient gives him one pill and that patient now you know is doing better and perhaps he's a hero but then when we say the word hero we don't think of nurses or doctors and so many other professions which sound mundane we think about a really gigantic man with lots of muscles walking down a hill climbing up a mountain with a sword trying to kill a dragon and that sounds highly risky and sexy and interesting similarly in asset classes crypto and understood shares all of this sounds like the He-Man and everyone wants to go after it because it feels highrisk High reward and there's a thrill to it but the truth is when you're investing you're not really looking for a thrill you're actually trying to look for some kind of growth so don't fall for this hero fallacy where shiny objects just look pretty and you want to own them because they're shiny then we have the bandwagon effect I remember going with Swati to Bali and there were four different ice cream shops and I had to choose one one shop had a really long line and everyone was just standing in line there we didn't have time we also stood in line despite the other ice cream shops not having a queue and got our ice cream the ice cream sucked and we didn't finish it and then we found out that everyone in line were actually the employees of that ice cream shop when we see a line we feel like getting into it If Everyone likes it perhaps I will like it too and I think stock markets work very similarly when everyone is going after a shiny object and there's a long line you feel the foro and you want to do it never let the bandwagon effect feel like I should do this cuz everyone else is probably do a little bit of analysis and watch our videos so you can learn how to do that analysis if you had to take away one thing from this video I think the one thing would be this financial markets operate with greed everyone trying to sell you a financial product is making money by selling you a dream in the future your job is to make sure that this person is not overselling your job is to understand the risks I know sometimes the de influencing series sounds like we keep talking about risks too much but it's important because the internet is only talking about greed so someone has to balance the scales no someone has to say of course there's a chance of you doing well but what about the risks which is why the D influencing series with all of this just talks about the bad stuff the risks that no one does so I really hope you appreciate bringing the risks to light because once you understand the risks and once you know the worst case scenario you will conquer something that no one else has and that's fear the biggest fear in markets is my money will go away but if you have a good understanding of that you will survive the largest dips because you understand the risks so I hope this was helpful type the influencing Army in the comments below and tell us what next topic we should pick see you in the next episode old [Music] [Laughter]",

    "title_current": "Why MBA is the worst degree for Indians",
    "transcript_full": "Is doing an MBA really worth it? The fees you have paid, it's not worth it. MBA really worth it. In 2025, to understand this better we spoke to real people. So my name is Ujjwal. So I'm Henna. I'm Shivani. I'm Astha My name is Vibhor. Who actually completed an MBA in what happened a few years after. We also looked at the data to answer all of these questions and I was amazed. You know the MBA is the most sought after master degree not only in India but in America as well. Like in India, we have 3 lakh people applying for the common admission test. The major reason why people get into MBAs Just like Vibhor, Ujjwal and Astha. They actually want a better salary package. According to this IIT Roorkee study. This is why people want to do it. And out of the 3 lakh people only 5,000 will actually get into the top institute. And I'm referring to an IIM over here. The MBA craze is not unique. Every single industry goes through an expansion and a contraction. And MBA is going through exactly the same thing. We had the craze of the BA degree. Yes, Bachelor of Arts. Over here we can see that about 50 lakh people were enrolled in a BA in 1990-91. But in 2020-2021 it was 4 crores. Because people thought this is the basic degree. You need to get into a government job or any job. So everyone took the BA degree. The same thing happened with engineering. We saw it with pilots. We see it in small industries. We saw it with product managers. We see it time and time again. But the difference is that MBA comes with a hefty price. Fees that I paid I think it was 24 lakhs if I'm not wrong. And then major part of the batch will take a loan. So did I. But wait. It's not just IIMs that can charge a hefty amount. It's other private colleges too. When I picked up the institute and the fees was 12 lakh something that time. 2009. But while you're doing this, there are other costs as well. Your travel cost, your hostel fees, your food, everything. You have your general expenses that you will do around the month. So when you take a loan, you basically take a loan for 30 or 32 lakhs. And usually you will look at how much you can earn by looking at a placement report and figure out the roi. But there are two invisible costs you're probably not thinking about. The first one is the interest cost. This is the most simplest to understand. If you're taking a loan of 20 lakh rupees over a period of seven to eight years, you'll probably end up paying 28 to 30 lakh rupees. The second cost is the opportunity cost. Now this one creates a little bit of anxiety. If you are doing an MBA for two years and you're not earning and let's say your salary before the MBA was say 7 lakh rupees, you have lost 7+7, 14 lakh rupees and maybe an appraisal of 10% somewhere in between in these two years in exchange to earn that MBA. But of course you're paying such a hefty amount, you'll get some value out of it, right? Maybe in the form of placements and how much your first salary can be after you're out of the college. I got placed into RP Sanjeev Goenka Group. I got a stipend of not sure, but about 1.3 or 1.4 lakh per month. So that was the stipend that. But if I have to think about averages that would range around Rs. 80,000 to 1 lakh. So I'm assuming that that would have been risen to about 1.3 to 1.5 lakhs right now as an average, the job offer I got from College was about 21 LPA. So yeah, I think you can expect about that range in terms of salary packages. Highest would range up to 70, 80 lakhs, lowest would be about 12, 12, 13 LPA is what I would think about. Okay, so it seems like the ROI with top colleges seems to be good. But what about the other colleges, the not so famous ones, the new ones, the private ones, the ones you probably haven't heard of but still charge lakhs of rupees. They highlight that we give 100% placement. And what do you mean by 100% placement? Maybe somebody is getting placed on 4 lakh or 5 lakh package. That is nothing. You know the fees you have paid, it's not worth it. There are so many mid tier and low tier colleges in the country. With the 'MBA' title, they sell you you a dream. I don't think that most institutes provide the value that they charge for. Even now when someone asks me recommendations for an MBA college, I highly recommend that don't pursue an MBA if you're not getting into the top 20 colleges in the country. After that it's like, for lack of a better word, garbage. Like now your impressions of what the placements are may be different but the fact is if you have an MBA tag from a top tier college, recruiters do notice. I know in office when we are looking to hire someone and someone has a tag of IIM or XLRI etc. We take a little more effort to read who they are, what they've done. And I've also noticed their communication skills are better than a lot of other people. It is a good filter. There is no doubt about it. The curriculum is so smartly designed that you will learn so many things while playing. As in there will be a lot of competitions or lot of activities designed for people to innate leadership skills to get in a group, how to work in a group. So these things will be taught with curriculum and not just by theory. Now cut to you enter the MBA institute. But it's not just the interpersonal skills you develop during mba. I mean it's also about the connects with your strong alumni network. I mean it gives you access to valuable relationships and opportunities and that probably does shape your career, doesn't it? I could visit anywhere right now in India. We have a group of all IIM Calcutta alumni. I can ask around anything to anyone. I went to Lucknow, I had a problem. My parents were in Lucknow. I needed a doctor to be searched for. I posted in that group. Is there someone who I can get in touch with? Quickly I got 2-3 messages about doctors in Lucknow who they could consult on. How can you put in value to that? A friend of mine used to say this a lot And it is very very true. It is for the network than it is for the salary packages. I won't say skills. So the big question remains, is MBA really worth it in today's time. Till date it does give credibility. It gives an edge to other profiles. But provided it's done from a good institute, the network or the kind of exposure that you're talking about that you'll get in those places will be very good. So it comes down to two things. First, do you really have some skill that you can polish and become really valuable in the world? Because it seems like the world is moving from degree based recognition to skill based recognition. Second, do you think that the MBA will make you special? This is a really important question. Just going there does not give you any skills. You can be there, do nothing for two years and still come out and you will be a graduate of ABC College. So if you think you are learning something every week you have an edge and the MBA just adds to it, then maybe you should do the mba. But if you think the only thing in your life defining your career is the mba, probably it won't really help. The three Idiots how the movie has actually been framed is very very correct. Run after excellence, exposure, learning and ultimately success or packages will get to you.",

    "transcript_full": "Hello. >> Oh, thank you. Hey, >> a big shake. >> I've not given any bonus to you. How the hell did you buy all this? >> I used to buy things on cash, but then I realized I wasn't saving enough. So, I found this very amazing way. No cost EMI. >> Wait, you bought all of this on no cost EMI? >> Yes. You have made a mistake. >> I don't think so. >> If I prove that no cost EMI is not what you think it is and you're not saving money, then I get to cut half your bonus. I'll save my money. >> If if you are not able to prove so bonus double and from my wish list items, you have to buy five things >> and prove it. Come with expensive. >> No cost. >> Yes sir. >> It's very expensive. >> Okay. So we have three options. We have cash where you pay everything up front. We have the EMI. The third is the no cost EMI. First, >> let's go to no cost EMI. First two to I think we know >> patience. We'll start with cash. Cash may we will pay 1 lakh rupees up front from our bank account. >> From our bank account to the vendor. I'll take the phone. [music] Done. >> Okay. So then let's go to normal EMI. So over here we have this. The EMI uh that comes out is 9,000 rupees. The total is 12 EMIs that you pay. [music] So 1 lak 8,877. >> This is interest EMI. Of course we know we have to pay interest. What's the point? >> Point is then we have total interest. [music] We have GST on the interest. We have processing fee. We have GST on the processing fee. And then the grand total after all of this is we pay an extra 10,710 rupees to the bank because we have bought it on EMI. That's what the option is. Interest, EMI. >> Yes. >> Point number three. >> The point is we should compare all the three options and know how much we're paying extra. So, cash zero. This is 10,700 more. >> Third option. >> Let's see the third option. >> I'll do the calculation because this is my bonus and my wish list. Yes, sir. >> Okay. Do you know how no cost EMI works? >> Yes. >> Explain. >> Why are they giving you a product for no cost, no interest? >> Because they love me. [music] >> Of course not. Let me explain how this works. So let's suppose you want to buy [music] a phone and the phone costs 1 lakh rupees correct? >> Now um [music] to buy this you either choose cash like we discussed or you choose the EMI option. >> EMI >> and the EMI option has interest on it. So they say okay I will allow you to pay for this over the next [music] let's say 12 months but I'll charge 10,000 rupees interest [music] and then what the bank will do is that they'll divide this total 1 lakh 10,000 into 12 bits and [music] that's how much you pay but in the no cost option [music] you are paying 1 lak rupees >> only [music] >> only and this is divided into 12 so this 10,000 why are they waving it I am paying one lakh only. >> Here's how it works. So first you're going to an electronic store >> and that electronic store can be digital or physical. Let's imagine a physical store. You go there. You say this is a nice this is a nice phone. I want to buy it. How much is it? He says 1 lakh rupees. I'm like great give me no cost EMI. He says cool. This is our financing partner. It could be a bank, could be an NBFC. And the NBFC says or the bank says I want to charge this 10,000 rupees but the buyer will not pay for it. >> Yes, >> this will be paid for by the electronic store to the bank. >> I am paying one lakh only. No >> the NBFC. >> So the bank NBFC says by this is what I'll make from this transaction. So now the question is why is the retailer paying this extra 10,000 to this bank over here. to to give you the benefit cuz it makes a 10,000 loss. It's selling for 90,000 now, right? >> Then why is he doing it? >> He is doing it because the bank says because I'm offering this at a 12 EMI on just this and I'm calling it no cost. People like Abhishek will think oh this EMI option only two people will buy but no cost 10 people will buy in sale. That's how no cost works. So it is no cost for you. >> I knew it. I knew it. And the retailer does it to sell more phones. So that is good. Sorry, they don't understand one thing. Actually, two things. First, there are some hidden costs. And two, I'll tell you after this. Okay. So, read this for me. >> Month. >> Okay. >> Opening balance. >> What is that? >> Opening balance. >> Okay. That's the amount that you have left to pay. >> Principal. All right. And then you have >> interest. >> And then you have the EMI. Correct. >> Okay. Then you have the closing balance. The amount that is left >> GST. >> Yeah. >> On interest. >> I'm paying GST on my phone EMI. But sir, on my home loans to I don't pay any GST. No, it's just the [music] standard EMI. >> So goods that you buy on credit stuff like this, you have to pay GST on the interest. So what these banks do is that even if there's no interest in all, they still have to count something as principal, something as interest. >> So then they can decide that proportion and therefore that cost is something that no one really knows. So that adds up a little bit. It's not a big amount, but you should know that this happens. Can you read what this totals up to? >> EMI principal shown on statement is 91,847. >> Okay. >> EMI interest shown on statement 8,000. Sum of 12 EMIs excluding GST is [music] 1 lakh. GST on interest is 1467 which is amount processing fee 199 GST on processing [music] fees 36 rupees. Processing fees including GST. Oh, it's total only 235. >> So what's the net [music] extra paid over the 1 lakh rupees? >> 1,72. It is not too much. Now >> if it doesn't feel like too much already, look at this. Siam bought an electronic item at a no cost EMI. But when he tried to cancel it midway, this popped on his screen. That's the principal outstanding 17,550. Fair enough. But here's when it gets tricky. There's a foreclosure fee of 526. You're paying extra just to close the loan early. But wasn't this no cost EMI? Then GST on the foreclosure fee. The penalty you paid also gets taxed cuz it's a service, right? Next month's installment's interest, but he's cancelelling today. But um yeah, I guess it is what it is. And finally, GST on that interest of 42. So the total payable is 18,447. That's almost 900 in random charges for cancelelling your own no cost EMI. So now can you compare what all the three look like? >> Uh cash on no credit card is a luck which you actually pay. >> No cost on credit card is 1,700 only. And normally am I Oh, you are paying 10,000. So, [clears throat] I'm not doing anything wrong. Correct. Correct. Bonus double. Yes. Completely wrong. >> Completely wrong. If you don't want to give me bonus, it's okay. Accept it that you lost. >> I did not. >> I have another sheet obviously. >> Of course. >> And I need you to fill this up. >> I want you to fill it up too or just follow what other writing. >> What's your monthly income? >> Oh my god. Okay, it's happening. >> Sorry. Sorry. One [music] lakh. >> What's your total monthly EMIs put all together? >> My 40,000 >> a month. A month. No cost EMIs. You will lose. It's okay. Bonus ready. >> What is your total liquid saving? >> 90,000. 90,000. >> You have 90,000 liquid cash. >> Yes. [music] >> And then tell me, could you pay the full EMI by yourself? >> Yes. >> All right. And did you choose the EMI because it felt like yeah I don't have to give the entire amount we going into the psychology of why you're taking an EMI. Did you feel like okay I don't have to pay the entire amount I have to pay a small portion I can keep some money in my account. [music] >> That's yes >> right I can keep some money. I'm saving money. >> Yes. >> Perfect. And [music] then so you put yes put yes >> oh sorry done. >> Now how many EMIs are you currently paying? Auto debits everything. P five five five put five and uh have you ever delayed any or struggled then you did it salary late so put yes salary late [music] >> yes yes yes >> and did you pick a no cost EMI even if you have your full cash option available maybe you have cash in the account but you choose no cost because saving money it's more convenient >> yes Right. Put yes. All right. [music] So now after we've done this calculation, >> what is this sir? This is E EMI to income ratio. >> 40%. Which means 40% of his salary >> is being spent on an EMI. What's >> financial buffer? This is your runway which means in a worst case scenario [music] if he loses his job anything can happen and your income becomes zero. Now how many months does it take until you run out? 90,000 is your bank balance 40,000 is your monthly payment. 2 months is 80,000 left with 10,000. >> Oh >> can you do 5,000 per month in living expenses? Yes, I don't think so. If you're someone who has taken too many no cost EMIs, these two numbers can show if you are in trouble. So, think about this, okay? Divide your life into two parts. Let's say this is your this is 10 years old. >> How long do you think you live? >> 80. [music] >> 80. >> 80. Let's say 80. Now, I would like to divide this life into maybe uh let's say >> two parts. And I would like to say high energy [music] and here I would like to say want peace. Okay. So my question is all of us are trying to buy stuff here buy stuff and think [music] we'll experience life later but experience to energy when we are after 60. That is true. >> And most likely your salary, everything, your bonuses over a period of time, 20s, 30s, 40s will compound and grow. So why don't we switch this? [music] If you switched it, then you optimize for experiences now and material later on. >> I I'll find a balance. There's no point of me buying a MacBook Pro or an iPhone probably >> if you can't afford it. If you can, you must buy because you're 25 only once. And yolo is makes sense. But too much yolo is a big problem because imagine if you can't buy peace when you're older because 40% [music] of your salary is going EMI. So my point is why the no cost EMI loses and why I win this bet is because at the end of the day you have taken a loan and the loan is the issue. The comparison over here cash versus EMI that's not the point. The point is that you have taken 40% of your income and it's going as an EMI. Reduce this to as much as you can. I promise you, you have such a long life. You will get everything you wanted, just not all at once. And that's okay. >> Sir, you are very clever. Bonus. But I hope you learned this entire concept and the psychology behind this because money is not about Excel sheets. >> It is Excel sheets for you. It's about how you feel. >> Bonus wish list.",

    "transcript_full": "1 CR rupees passively through Drop Shipping I think this is really cool and let's do one thing in this video let's figure out how to make this money passively in three simple steps so you and I can make a lot of money but in true de influencing style we look at the good and the bad we'll understand the risks because these guys they won't tell you so let's start with step number one before we understand Drop Shipping let's understand e-commerce and let's suppose uh I I am the manufacturer of bamboo cotton t-shirts it's a really cool brand and you see all these machines over here I got them I own them they're imported and I'll manufacture them and keep all different sizes medium small large XL you name it all these boxes are full of my stock full of my inventory now all I need to do is make sure I have a website of my company with all of this listed so a person can place an order make the payment as soon as I receive the order I'll ship this right to the user and hopefully I made some money on that order now as a drop shipper what I want to do is not have all this stock and all these machines so what's left is a website I put the products I wait for an order and I ship it but wait if I don't have the manufacturing and I don't have the stock how will I even send the product I don't have it right and here's the trick in this amazing business I can just connect to another manufacturer who's already holding all the stock has all the machines and I simply forward my order from the customer to him and say bro can you send me this this is the address for the customer thanks tata bye and I can enjoy the money that I can make because all of this can be automated guys the beauty is that I buy that t-shirt for 200 and sell it to you sorry the customer for 250 and that 50 rupees is all the money I have and multiplied by number of orders I'll become rich and this Lamborghini will be mine and so will this house with pool you know he but there is one problem because I'm ordering it from someone else the delivery time is a little longer but it's okay you like the t-shirts no it's fine now don't pause the video right now and create your website I'll tell you how to make money in this be patient so basically step number one you are supposed to find a trending product because see as drop shippers we flow with the trend we go with the trend we find a trend and then we find the product once we figured out the product we look for suppliers and manufacturers who can give me the product sometimes we also test the quality and all but it's okay I mean as long as the picture is good it's fine then step number three we create this on a website wait a beautiful website where we have all the product and somehow I have to do some marketing to send users to this website place the order and once the order is placed and we received the money I simply forward it to the supplier if there's customer complaint haven't figured that one out yet but that's the business now before I tell you how to make that 1 CR per month could be a week also let me also tell you the advantages of Drop Shipping number one the startup costs are actually smaller right like imagine having to buy all of these machines setting them up paying rent and then having the inventory I mean that's expensive as a drop shipper I'll spend on maybe a Shopify website maybe the domain I'll purchase maybe I'll spend I don't know 5,000 6,000 rupees on sampling the product with a few people seeing if they like it and that's about it maybe I'll run some ads to send people to the website to actually purchase the item but apart from that the startup costs are smaller the second Advantage is that you can offer items almost instantly if I like something in the middle of the night I'm like dude this is a great product supplier looks good I can take the picture put it on my website and suddenly overnight I have a new product on my business but if I was doing normal e-commerce I couldn't do that I mean I'd have to manufacture test quality oh my God all those things in this case it won't matter I can offer more variety with very little effort another Advantage is that I can test the market I mean imagine I want to release a new kind of water bottle with a measuring device telling me when to drink the water maybe it's connected by bluetooth telling me I've not hydrated enough uh if I had to man manufacture this I had to spend so much time in the manufacturing stocking Etc in this case I would find a supplier put it online for a week see if it's selling if it's not it's out and I'll just sell something else so testing the market with Drop Shipping becomes really interesting really easy you become sort of like an e-commerce scientist and the obvious thing here is there is low effort High income you just need a good Netflix subscription at home Couch Potato some chips the business will run on its own there is no startup capital and all of that and customer service it doesn't matter because people are buying the e-commerce thing the supplier will take care of it even if he doesn't I'll change the product so no customer service needs to be done either but you see I think this is a good business because effort is low and passive income excited now that was chapter one on you you getting that Lamborghini and whatever the hell you need for 1 rupees a month but to get from chapter 1 to chapter 10 you will have to do something different you will have to attend my workshop in this Workshop you will learn the secrets of e-commerce Drop Shipping to make 1 CR per week we will first cover the very first basic how to set up your website and make e-commerce platform very good how to make ads so that people are kicking clicking and coming on the website and then converting which turns into money then we will figure out how to make the website so beautiful that the conversion actually happens but the most important thing in Final Chapter we will cover how to select business partner supplier so we can get the Mal and then sell the m and customer service chapter is not included hold up the problem here is we are not talking about the risks I mean if you look at all these videos on YouTube all these channels on Insta all these guys are promising passive income without you working at all and the problem is not the telegram group or the workshop or the course for knowledge it's perfectly fine the problem is when someone is trying to sell you greed saying that if you do X you can earn money without working this entire notion is total nonsense the first thing you'll notice is that they'll sell you some sort of greed make X lak or X cor passively by doing very little effort that's the first red flag the second red flag is when someone shows you an amazing lifestyle and says look at all of this I have it you can have it too that again is another red flag the third is a lot of them don't really have a track record that is at least a decade long where they they themselves have created some brand of their own and seen some kind of success the only stories they tell are verified by testimonials of other people saying how great this teacher is how great this businessman is and how they have benefited but you really don't see their actual product anywhere unless he shows it to you and he puts in lots and lots of effort to convince you and it becomes easy for the average person to say maybe there's something here maybe I should join this class for 10 Rupees which he'll later sell for a lot more and try to change my life the question comes to you if someone is trying to sell you greed just step away so A Drop Shipping business is like any other business this means you will have to spend time learning SEO learning brand building actually creating an audience finding out what a user needs building a marketing team building a product team doing actual testing the list just goes on it's like any other business but there's one more problem in this Drop Shipping business as a model and that model changed with Amazon Prime Amazon Prime came around 2016 if I'm not mistaken and at that time they said within 48 hours we'll deliver Prime products at any Metro destination now back then this was crazy things would take up to a week to get delivered and if I got something within 2 days sometimes even one day it felt like magic and now with quick Commerce where the delivery times are even smaller not for e-commerce but for something else customer expectations have changed so the question is if someone is doing Drop Shipping and you receive that item after a week or 10 days or 20 days would that customer actually wait in most cases a large number of customers will not wait but I guess a small set of customers might if you have a novelty item if you are building an e-commerce brand we'd love to understand your story we know how difficult it is to actually create a business so please put it in the comments below we like it and H it so everyone can see your struggles and your successes and every journey is 5 to 10 years you will have to do it but subscribe so if you like this episode hit that like hit that subscribe and I'll see you in the next episode [Music] any opinion guys though you guys busy this weekend huh drop",

    "transcript_full": "does your life insurance give you any returns returns life insurance no out of all the life insurances possible I'm going to give you the best one this one right here please surrender the one you have right now this one will give you 10% what don't get too excited you don't get involved sir this will also give you the life cover in even more than last time and the returns isn't that amazing amazing give me it something obviously was wrong in this conversation so we thought in this episode of De influencing let's talk about well we have a special guest and in through the influencing style we will talk about the ugly The Good the Bad and everything you need to know about life or term insurance as we like to call it because Mr Raman will never tell you all of this [Music] [Music] here are five hidden tricks to buy the best life insurance there not only will this cover your loved ones and your family in case of your demise it will also give you returns so let's start with step number one trick number one if you are young then you can save on life insurance premiums by not getting it because you don't have dependence your family is already earning and you're young and you are already earning for many years so 5 years you'll save the insurance premium that's actually not true because even though you may not have dependence right now there's no guarantee that you won't have dependence in the future most people tend to get married between the ages of 25 and 35 and if you are one of those people you'll quickly see that your spouse may be dependent on you or your kids they may need help with education they may need help with growing up and generally they are your dependents so if you tend to buy a life insurance or a term insurance policy early you tend to get lower premiums also you tend to lessen the risk of rejection because after 30 you may have lifestyle diseases like diabetes blood pressure Etc and insurance companies may deny your application altogether at which point you may not even get a policy okay fine but think about it if I'm 25 for 5 years if I don't buy any insurance I saved 5 years of Premium no yeah but then again you also save premiums by locking in your premiums early by buying early what is that if you buy early your premiums are lower and they get locked in which means your premiums will stay the same until the policy matures which usually I didn't know about this loot but here is Trick number two you must have heard about ulips but the new kind of ulips which I'm going to tell you will change your life they not only give you life cover they also give you very good returns so here are the life I know that there are plans right now especially ulips that actually probably give you decent returns without a lot of charges but the thing is even those plant the best plant in the market you could take them and you could simply compare them to a simple mutual fund plus a term insurance plan so instead of just putting all your premiums in one UL plan that promises better returns you can just separate those premiums pay for a life insurance plan a term insurance plan separately and then invest your money directly in mutual funds so you have to pay almost no charges so that's still a better alternative what what returns are these ulips giving um they probably give you somewhere around 5 6% oh I didn't know that yeah because index funds like 12% uh yes I mean in the long term you could probably make more without the excess charges even those low charges plan actually promise you I did not know that they give uh that but I think we should talk about another thing see I'm paying all these premiums sh and I'm sure you didn't know this all this premium adds up I'm paying every year correct correct it's an expense yes I can do so much with this yes what if I selected and we are at hack number three where you can add something called a rider which gives all that premium back to you once the policy ends it's very simple you're paying the premium and then at the end you get all the premium back isn't that perfect so if you don't die you get the money back that's not bad no no and there's a link in the description wa wait wait wait the return of Premium plans may look good on paper but technically they still don't make Financial sense because even though the insurance companies promis to pay all of your premiums back if you survive the tenure of the plan do know that they won't return the GST also if you're looking to buy a plan that promises to return your premiums at some point in time in the future they also tell you that you have to pay a higher premium when you buy a plan right now example so if you're buying a regular term insurance plan you may be paying say 15,000 rupees but if you want to buy a plan that returns your premium after you survive the tenure then you may have to pay somewhere between 20 to 25,000 rupees which if you think about it you can just put all of those extra premiums in a separate index fund and make as much money or even more money than the premiums you get at the age of 65 then why was I saying it's marketing we'll cut this just cut this vaa but you know but you know there's one more trick you know the other day I went to the mall and I was at one of these stores and I had to buy a phone so they said no worries take a no cost Emi option where basically I didn't pay any interest and I was able to take it now there's also the same concept in life insurance it's called a zero cost plan where basically all the premium that I paid will come back and I'm not paying the extra premium I paid in the other one that I showed normal premium it's normal premium and you get it back I think this is pretty no no no no no I I get that zero cost plans are also very good on paper but the problem is see when you're buying a zero cost plan you may not have to pay the extra premiums however insurance companies will force you to forego your plan even before the tenure ends wait one minute so you said when I turn 50 or something around that age I have to surrender the plan which means if something happens to me after 50 I cannot get that benefit you basically you won't have the term plan to get any benefit no that's cool but I want to talk about another feature about all term insurances and those are Riders so for example there is one Rider called terminal illness now this Rider basically covers if the doctor tells you that you are terminally ill which means you can pass away in the next few months that entire sum insur is given to you while you're alive that's right while you're alive and you can use this money um any way you see fit uh so I yeah I mean it makes sense and obviously receiving the sum a short which could add up to one two three CR for most people looks enticing on paper but there is a catch okay see before releasing the Corpus the insurance company will ask your treating doctor to provide a certificate that states that you're likely to die in the next few months and I'm guessing that your treating doctor will never do that because he'll believe that no matter how Grim the chances are you may survive instead I suggest something else I suggest you take a critical illness Rider because that makes more sense for yeah I'll explain the critical Rider then terminal illness but a critical illness plan is interesting because serious you will get a some assur that you've already pred decided while you were taking the insurance policy now imagine pman heart disease but why should you waste money on this Rider you may not know this but a health insurance will cover it so you don't need to actually take this PR it doesn't work that way see the thing about critical illnesses is that while a health insurance policy pays for your hospitalization expenses you have to consider what happens about the loss of income when you have a critical disease cancer and you're in a hospital you're likely to not be working so you will likely have to quit working work and if you're quitting work you have to think what happens to your income if you have no income how will your dependent survive how will they deal with the vagaries of life so my suggestion is to buy a critical illness Rider with a term insurance plan because you can use that money say 10 20 30 lakhs and replace your lost income and that makes a lot more sense than simply relying on your health insurance plan and which is why a critical illness Rider is important in a term insurance yeah I mean that's simple that's exactly how you put it so now I'd like to talk about how you can save your premium with the smoking bit I'm sure you've heard about this if you're a smoker you'll pay this much premium if you're a non-smoker you'll pay this much premium now here's the trick if you haven't smoked in the last few weeks I'm sure you can control it simply don't tell when you have the test even if they take the blood test and do all the tests the nicotine won't show up if you've not smoked for the last few weeks which means you will save your premium from this to this isn't that amazing are you impressed I'm not quite because the problem is even though it makes sense not to declare it and pay the lower premiums there is still a way for insurance companies to figure out if you smoked or not so let's suppose we take a use case you've smoked in the last few weeks you don't declare it because you don't think the nicotine test will show any abnormalities and you get the policy issued and then unfortunately something happens to you say a few years down the line and you pass away it's not to say that the insurance company will immediately disperse the claim see actually what happens is they'll do a thorough investigation and at any point if they find even the remotest evidence even a Facebook photo long you know that's not true actually we know of companies that actually send out people to investigate everything your social media profiles every relative you know your school friends everything that they can find because they're paying out crads so they will invest the money to make sure that they don't pay out CL and they use it as evidence yes and if they can find evidence to categorically show that you've smoked in the last few weeks during which you made the Declaration then they have grounds to deny your claim so I don't think you should be lying on that front either just to save the premiums so I have no more tricks up my sleeve but what I do have is a checklist I hope you like this format if you follow this checklist you can select the right insurer now a policy can be quite Nuance but selecting the right insurer is really important so let's start with this fourpoint checklist we've also added all of the details in the description number one is the claim settlement ratio now very simply put the number of claims versus the number of settlements so if there are 100 claims how many of them were actually settled a good insurer would have 98 99% claim settlement ratio you can find this in the annual report of aai annual report over there it includes all of this we've included a link in the description to that annual report as well and the second ratio is amount settlement ratio because it's very easy to game the claim settlement ratio simply by paying out nine claims and then denying that one claim that is very very expensive so nine claims worth one crores I'll pass all of them and then there's one claim that's worth 10 CR I'm going to hold on to this so it's important to look at the total amount settled ratio because it also tells you the total amount settled versus the total amount claimed so a number between 90 and 95 is usually good and we believe that that's what you should do if you're considering your insurer checklist number three is number of complaints or volume of complaints this may be interesting because there could be a good claim settlement ratio but you also want to see how many complaints it's receiving if their insurance agents actually misso the product the volume of complaints is likely to be higher now there could be number of reasons for this but basically you don't want the number of complaints to be higher for the insurance provider you select this is on a base of 10,000 claims to basically normalize this number and make it easier to understand make sure you find this on the insurers website you could find it in different areas you'll have to do some snooping it could even be in the investor presentation in the investor section but you will find this information and you can compare and see where the volume of complaints is higher and where the volume complaints is lower and the final thing that you have to look at is the scale of business because it's very easy for me to sell 10 policies and settle one claim because I've only received one claim and claim 100% and claim settlement ratio but it's very hard to do this on a base of say one lakh policies right so you have to look at the scale of the insurance companies and how long they've been around because if they've been around long you can trust that they'll be around to pay your claims as well super I hope you found this interesting flew all the way from Bangalore over here just to discuss it so no money exchange hands correct and never will and we just thought he understands this topic so much better than we ever would which is why he was here helping us with this piece of content now I'd recommend if you thought this was interesting visit ditto they have a free consultation check it out um understand about your policy have some questions and understand it so is the least we can do for you for coming all the way here and if you have any questions you put it in the comments below will answer them cuz I don't know enough and I'll see you in the next episode what's the next point I think this came out pretty well yeah very good the points are so good uh premiums back without asking you to pay the extra premium in the beginning sorry I zoned out H yeah so so return of Premium plans",

    "transcript_full": "hi friends want to be a value investor I can make you one just like this person just like this person and this person you will also become a value investor very simply we'll use a tool called PE ratio this financial ratio can find if company's too much undervalue or too much overvalue all we need to do is find a stock under pe10 market cap under 5,000 CR and w you can put all your savings into these companies the promoters left no it's Sal fundamental I think uh let me get back to you where this guy go clearly something was wrong with that pitch how can one single ratio the p ratio decide whether a stock is a value stock or not and can you really become a value investor actually everyone thinks thinks the p ratio is a great way to find a stock and we'll demystify sorry de influence p ratio in this episode we're going to talk about the good the bad cuz clearly these guys won't tell you we're going to give you a checklist so watch this video till the [Music] end the most important tool any investor has is looking at the earnings of a company of course there are a lot of other metrics but earnings is really really important now I want you to go back 50 60 years and think about the nature of earnings and companies which were listed think about a good company a couple decades back it could be say a railroad company going and providing Logistics and supplying stuff throughout America and this is a very good example because you could sort of predict where and how much money this company could make now could this company become 10x 20x in a single year in terms of earnings probably not it's a little more predictable and you know its boundaries but think about the companies which are listing nowadays in India a lot of them are high tech growth companies actually even in the NASDAQ you get similar companies where a company could become 5x or 10x in a single year because technology has leverage and humans are using that leverage so the nature of growth that means the nature of earnings which means the nature of price to earnings is also changing so with that context let's start with the first myth is that you can pick any low PE stock it's kind of funny PE low it might be good and you trust that P number this is the first problem so to illustrate I have an actual example over here let's look at um any pnl of any company so after going through all of this filtration process I'm calling it filtration you come with the final number which is your profit after tax and it's from this number that we derive our p ratio interesting which means if any of these numbers above change the p ratio changes a lot make sense make sense so let's see a real example over here its p ratio is 19 which was the lowest amongst all the other companies so it seemed like a good pick now let's look at the pnl here you'll see revenue from operations is zero that's not a printing mistake it's under it's actually zero then we'll see there is other income over here and if you scroll right down you'll notice exceptional items of 97,1 162 the number is in LHS so this is basically 971 crores roughly and you'll notice at the end they actually show a profit now any normal investor would look at the p ratio see it's made a profit and assume it's great but this could be because they sold a land parcel or something else that's not core to the business take a minute to think about this this business has zero Revenue has shown a profit from other income and its p ratio is 19 can you trust the p ratio the problem is not with the company it's a listed entity and has given all the information disclosed it as per law the problem is you you did not check so don't trust that p ratio without looking at the financials of how the company earned that year myth number two you can apply p ratio to any sector okay guys um every sector has its own ratio and p ratio may not apply let's see an example like a high technology growth sector so what I'll do is I'll show you a real company over here obviously I'll remove the name and we can see over here that this company year on year is net profit minus - 63 -1- 59 so on so forth um so it doesn't seem like a good company if you just look at the net profit and obviously there is no p ratio because there is no profit but if you look up and look at its sales you can see that the sales sometimes does a 100% growth so this company is probably sacrificing a net profit for a high growth because it thinks there is a big Market to capture in a short period of time of 5 to 10 years you can also find this in companies like Amazon which are famous for not making money for a really long period of time to capture a really large market and its stock price looks like this now does this mean that the p ratio can be used in companies like this no you'll have to find a different kind of analysis one ratio would probably be price to sales is if you're a high Growth Company then okay I are you doing high growth in sales or not I'm not saying buy or sell this company but the simple thing of applying a p ratio in any sector doesn't make sense another interesting sector is the biotech and Pharma sector there's a lot of effort because a medicine can take a life so it has to be tested properly and take a look at this company over here found this very interesting in fact I've never seen this in my life this came out while we were researching for this and you can see that this company has expenses like any company but there's a line item over here that says clinical trial expenses and product development right here isn't this so high this company's sole job is to do research and development of drugs so it's expected not to make high sales and high profit every single year it finds this one drug and that does well and it supplies it to its mother company whose job is to produce High sales growth over a period of time so applying a p ratio on this kind of company will make no sense and one more example is a Capital intensive industry this could be anything from the guys making the metro to a fashion retailer which is manufacturing all its clothes take a look at one such example here where the sales growth is from 1,800 CR all the way to 11,000 CR you can see the operating expenses is nice the operating profit is also fairly decent but then come two line items which are the largest expense the first is depreciation and the next is interest this means this company is capital intensive it's probably buying a lot of machines and showing the depreciation over here like it should and therefore the net profit actually becomes minus or really really low so looking at a p ratio over here may not make sense a better metric is probably looking at EV to Aba because the ABA actually is before depreciation and doesn't account for that non-cash loss happening my point is simple every industry needs a different way of looking at it a different way of looking at the Met you can't just say p ratio I'll use p ratio on any sector the third myth is that you can use the p ratio at any given point of time you see just like the economy goes through booms and bust Cycles so does a business and you can see that in its earnings so if you look at say this company over here this is real data by the way I've removed the name of the company and this is the earnings of that company in EPS of course you can see at a certain time it is at high earnings then that earnings becomes negative then it becomes high again negative notice that period is quite um cyclical it's almost the same right which means it goes through a cycle and this cycle is happening every 2 years or so so there is some kind of cadence now what's interesting is that if you know a business is cyclical then when you look at P suddenly everything changes over here you can notice when the earnings goes down the PE Ratio goes really high and maybe at this point of time you'll think I should not invest in this company the p ratio is very high but the truth is when the earnings go up that's when the price also spikes and you completely miss that so if you're trying to time the market by trying to buy low PE you'll completely miss the cycle because when earnings go down p ratio becomes High then when earnings go up p ratio does the opposite my point is very simple don't try to time the market just by looking at PE ratio especially if it's a cyclical company myth number four you can compare P ratios within an industry I know that sounds shocking the first thing you do is compare P ratios within the industry between the companies now this is fine but there's one Nuance that all of us forget and that is this let's suppose we have company 1 and we have company 2 both are from the same exact industry but company one's growth is exponential for whatever reason and Company's two growth is also growing but slightly slower so the p ratio for this one is likely to be higher let's say 25 but for a company like this in comparison the p ratio is likely to be lower let's say something like 11 now the reason this is because this is high growth and this is lower growth and the market the people participating in it price the PE Ratio accordingly now remember what is p ratio it's a multiple of the current earnings so if the market thinks that the earnings will continue to grow then they'll be okay with paying for a premium which is why you see high growth companies which are profitable always at a high p ratio they'll never be trading really really low unless a cataclysmic event happens over a short period of time usually they'll always be trading at a high p ratio and this is completely fine it's just reflecting growth the second aspect is risk and based on high or lower risk this p ratio again goes higher or lower so think about what could be risky for a business one could be say leverage let's say that they have high debt so I can say debt is high if that happens that increases the risk therefore the p ratio becomes low another could be just management I'll write MGMT maybe the management left maybe the management isn't good maybe there were false promises all these things add to risk and the p ratio reduces point is very simple don't look at p as a blanket to compare two companies even if it's in the same exact business because these things are company specific and here is a final checklist I know you didn't watch the video and you skipped to the checklist you cheater but if you did do that please go back and watch the video but let's come to the checklist first some Industries are cyclical so use that p ratio carefully second find out whether this is a high growth company and what's the risk based on that the p ratio could go up and down third be wary of earnings manipulation is that net profit actually true or was there other income and other things that affected it look over the last few years to see whether the numbers make sense or not don't just believe in the PE Ratio also know that P ratio alone will not work you'll have to look at a bunch of other metrics to find and become a value investor and finally we have uh nifty50 this is my personal bias I think looking at Nifty 50's p ratio gives you a fair idea whether the market is currently fairly valued overv valued or undervalued one problem here might be is that nifty50 is weighted which means that the top 10 stocks take away a lot of this versus the last 10 10 stocks but still it's a good way to know whether generally the market is in overvaluation or undervaluation Zone and perhaps looking at this will help you and the last point that p ratio cannot be used in all Industries but work really well where there's some predictable earnings so generally old businesses right known businesses like fmcg it paints where there is some predictable earnings it works pretty well over there if I miss something in the checklist put it in the comments below if you like this I love the influencing tell me what other topics we should pick up we've done a bunch of things before this check out our MLM scams that we did in the influencing check out this as well and watch them watch the entire playlist CU we've done a good job in doing this but we need some encouragement put something in the comments hit that like hit that subscribe and see you you know what I'm going to say in the next video hi friends now you can't car a camera this was vasu [Music] ending some people would have skipped",

    "transcript_full": "H uh thank you so much for your time the will get back to you with an [Music] update sir 1 minute sir sir no sir please sir save me [Music] sir I have had enough sir what happened man sir please save me sir what happened total waste s down settle down settle down what happened dude sir this was the 20th interview and these guys are totally confused they don't know I mean but it's not their fault dude think about it no one's actually taught them how to give an interview in school or college correct pyu experim but nobody has Tau his interview that's true sirart yes you are sir why don't you teach me how to take the interviews um we can try in fact why don't we talk about how you can crack your first interview and we'll do it from the point of view of a founder and hopefully he can fill the position that he's trying to hire for yes let's [Music] begin so abishek what did you not like about the cat okay sir overconfidence you won't believe the the guy I just interviewed he was was here the last social campaign member our social campaign we executed last week he was telling mistake I mean dude you are here for an interview you're not here to judge me got it and do you think some of them were not skilled but they pretended to be really skilled at something exactly yes oh interesting so you know why this is there's this really popular YouTube interview tips video if you watched you will actually feel people are seeing that video and doing the same thing in an interview did you also do that most of these guys they didn't they did not research about the company instead they're watching YouTube videos actually they think if they find interview tips online and they copy the same thing they'll get the job don't you think all of them have the same same answer oversmart they are they are acting over smart misguided not their fault when you go to a YouTube video and see that YouTube video and then go and say the same thing imagine people like us you took 20 interviews I've taken a th000 and a bunch of other people the HR is also taken a th000 she's heard them all so imagine if I tell her find a new unique person for this new job that I have and 20 guys give the same answer what will she think she'll think yeah they're all average right the person who's actually honest and says look I don't know where I'll be 5 years from now the person who says I am good at this you know at Sundays I do art that's why I'm a graphic designer that's what makes him unique the honesty of your skill sir I don't think this is right how can one build trust trust in the first conversation itself just start of 15 minutes I can't trust anyone good point it's not about honesty it's about trust so the person sitting over there and the other person sitting on the other side both have to trust each other exactly so if someone gives out uh his work or her work I think that builds trust so I could sense I'm building trust with you if you're really honest about your craft hopefully the interviewer will see that and because of that some trust can actually develop sir I have one question what's the brahmastra I mean one thing that I should say or one should say to get selected in a job okay so that's an interesting question why don't you um ask around the office and see what everyone says oh that sounds like a good plan yeah yeah what made you crack your first interview so I was researching about the company and the industry and uh when I was interviewed as well uh I was able to answer all the questions that were coming regarding these parameters um so I was very honest with my I had a onee gap after my graduation but I chose to not lie about it I was very honest and I Justified that in my answers oh that's smart so during my interview uh I was asked a lot of questions and I was grilled a lot but I kept my calm and I was confident and um I was honest about what I know and what I didn't know I was interviewing the role of social media expert and I was very honest that I haven't worked in finance but my personal interest uh lied there and I also mention mention I took up a 30-day posting challenge so I think that showed that I was very serious about my own personal projects and I was committed towards for a I did a couple of side projects and they were in the same field that I was interviewing for uh about the same topic and that really had my original ideas and how I executed them so the employer really liked that that's interesting thank you sir amazing answers we have got a very good team by way so when you are actually getting high for a position actually people are mostly hiring for potential which means 6 months B your 8 months B yeah 3 years B this person will become the person I need to be oh so most of them mold themselves as per the requirements I mean don't be dishonest about it but I think you should be honest about what you want to get better at now we obviously want a talented person who can grow and improve Etc but I'll be honest I also want someone to actually make my life easier if the founder or someone really senior in the company is working on something and he finds someone who can do it for him those hard problems are what you want to go after right okay so they should be able to solve the problem yes and not just do the task so if you're given a project and someone else is not doing the work you go catch that guy get him to finish it if someone's not available on a Friday make sure he completes it on a Thursday if someone says that he's not able to solve XYZ you go out and do it your job is to actually get the job done so the next time you write ownership and accountability know that this is what it means and if they ask you this in the interview now you know what it means and you can give an honest answer to it I just have one question I have a candidate and he has mentioned everything in the resume now in 15 minutes how will that person present that to me yeah that that's actually a little tough but you can do a few things to actually prepare and these are basic business as usual things which you should do which a lot of people aren't number one go and research the hell out of the company you're going to go to their website go to their about us search about their Founders search about the leadership teams what this company really wants what their reviews are and what their users think it's basically a detailed research about the company okay H so so when you go to the interview and abishek is on the other side and you say you know I've seen all the videos on psychology of money 101 I've also noticed that you used to run these other channels and now you're doing this I know notice that your vision is X and it would be great to be part of the company that's just a really nice way to start the first 5 minutes the second thing is actually dressing up for the interview M good suit polish shoes nice hair H it's actually really contextual so if you're joining a company to become a business developer that talks to other businesses so let's say you have to sell software to other large businesses let's say Microsoft or Amazon so do you think this person can come in a hoodie or in ch he should be there in formals no in this job type he has to be dressed pretty well now it could be a coat in this case or it could be just a nice shirt ironed well because this job requires that kind but let's say you're a developer do you think a developer needs to meet clients all the time no so if he comes in a hoodie and choules it's actually fine because you're judging them on their skill they could be Stellar coders and that's all that matters so basically every single job is contextual please be presentable makes sense right so imagine that person has followed this checklist okay he did his research right he's well presentable he knows everything about the company MH now what's the next step for that person well personally I would love to see demonstratable skills skills which means if this person is actually good at their job they should have some kind of work they've done in their previous experience right but these guys are just freshers the ones that I have interviewed okay fine you can do it as a hobby right like when you're studying and this is your first job if you were an artist I'm sure you would have made art if you're a program you would have a GitHub profile something to show that you're actually good at that craft and this is increasingly becoming more important than the resume itself proof of work I'll give you an example of a writer now this person walks in and this is a true story he's actually produced a few episodes on this channel this person comes in his ears go red he's unable to answer my questions and usually I put them under a lot of pressure and he completely cracks I ask him tell me an idea for AI using chat GPT and XYZ situation he was not able to answer I gave him another I said hey tell me about this he was unable to answer it and I rejected him so that's too much pressure it is somehow he said I'm not able to voice it out but I'm a good writer I said look I'll spend 25 minutes with you I'll give you one last chance here is my laptop you can't use chat CH this is the topic I want you to write an intro I'm giving you 15 minutes bye and I walked out of the room he actually wrote an amazing piece around Ai and the connection to today and it was beautifully written it was structured there was some research because he had already read about it and that is a good example of demonstratable skill or proof of work so generally you grill people a lot but I just have one question do you think today uh these people I mean these youngsters will they be able to handle this pressure maybe not but here is one way to easily do it or actually a few ways when you're being grilled by an interviewer the first thing you can do is just be honest if they ask a question which you have no idea about you should say good question I haven't thought about it I don't know the answer to it that Honesty actually works really well mostly the purpose of grilling is not to insult you or to put you in a position of weakness it's actually to see in a short period of time do you become agitated or show some extreme emotion the test is of pressure so when you have a timeline to deliver something that person will have to work under some sort of pressure right will that person just get angry and scream at everyone and spoil the culture sir I just had this very funny question now what if I turn the table around okay imagine a scene uh-huh the interview is grilling the interviewer right salary correct how will you reply speaking of Sal and negotiation there are some things you should never ever do the first one is negotiating too hard now if you've actually proven to the employer that you have the skills that they need and the business will move forward and they really need you and you've quoted a number they'll possibly make it actually happen and if 80% of your conversation is just around money that's a red flag so don't negotiate too hard rejected yes and there are a bunch of other things but if you want want us to cover salary negotiation put it in the comments give a bunch of likes the second thing which you must absolutely not do is voicing out your opinions of the company in a bad way feedback feedback is actually really good if you come as a UI person and say I think your app needs these changes and I think it could really improve this is really good that sounds smart okay but what if you went and said I'm not sure how your company functions or what everyone does here because it seems like the basic stuff is not thought only I mean maybe we've been very lucky and something could happen to the company at any moment so you know I did you guys a favor and made a few changes my side this is just a very bad tone and believe it or not a lot of people actually talk like that please don't do that it's constructive criticism be positive about it there's a way to say it say it you know all of these soft skills sound really obvious that everyone would probably do but when you're just starting your career clear out they are not that obvious and that's why he made this really obvious video which should exist on the internet but somehow doesn't correct so as you progress in your life you may think all of this is easy and obvious but not for the beginner if you know someone who's about to give their first interview or maybe you are that first interviewer person make sure you don't fuss about that first salary number or that company I wanted to get into XYZ and you're getting really frustrated intensed about it life this is not the start I was hoping for remember your first 10 lakhs 20 lakhs even one CR will not come from one negotiation or one company it will come because of the skill you have this is really a very long journey isn't it and it takes time sometimes what you have to focus on is your skill because that's ultimately where all your money is going to come from maybe you should worry about that and not take the stress of the first job the first salary Etc things will be okay if you're actually good at your job corre focus focus on building you've done pretty well for yourself you know what else is

more than them are you sitting at zero and want to become hero welcome to Nero part-time jobs here by simply doing a bunch of stuff no skill required no computer also required you can do it on your phone you can earn a lot of money this is the best data entry job possible click on the link below or call this number to start your journey immediately hustle mode [Music] on hello hey CH what work have you given here huh it's all inaccurate work sir you have caused irreparable damage to my company and I have signatures on a piece of legal paper you understand what I'm saying huh sir you understand s sorry 15,000 rupees I need back according to the agreement you understand sir 15 15,000 yes you owe me I sue you I don't have that much money sir I don't have I am suing you okay something was definitely not right with that conversation I mean part-time jobs and side hustles are absolutely fine but sometimes well 56% of the times every job seeker comes across some kind of scam so we thought why don't we talk about two of the most famous kinds of scams that will blow your mind and we'll also do a checklist so let's talk about the good the bad because no one else will [Music] so all part-time jobs and side hustles are not fake obviously there are a lot of legit jobs out there that you should explore but some of them are scams and we've picked the most popular scam to start with number one all these scams are actually placed in websites which are legit so you'll see them as Google sponsored ads in search results you'll also go to legit job websites and you'll see them there even classified listing so when you actually see the job it's not on a different website it's on a normal website where you do find nice good legal jobs so this one appears to also be legal now within the part-time jobs Universe there is one job that stands out the typing job the typing job seems easy to do and they make it easier by saying work for 15 minutes take home 25,000 rupees easy peasy and all you have to do is do data entry now what's data entry they will give you a database and you have to enter that somewhere else and do some kind of typing there is a large data dump that you have to look and type and you are paid per page per word or per hour for this work next the unsuspecting user signs up and begins his journey but before that they have a contract that sh no one ever really knows that it exists during the sign up process all they say is they say dude simply do a signature and take a photo and send that photo to us and the scamsters take that photograph like so and take it paste it on this agreement making it look like you actually signed it but it was simply just a photograph now this agreement contains something vile something scary the first thing this contract contains is that you have to be employed for 9 months or 11 months doesn't sound too bad the second Point says you have to have 90% accuracy in the submitted work also sounds okay until you read the next line which says otherwise user will be liable to pay rupees 15,000 rupees now the problem here is since there's no real way to verify whether the accuracy was 90% or 80% the scamster simply says you've signed a contract here it is you owe me 15,000 rupees in most cases people get really scared and pay that 15,000 rupees letting go of their hard-earned money and in many cases they have to borrow this because the scamster says we will run a case on you we will go against you we will go with all our might because you have a legal bind contract of course you know no one can force you into a legal contract like this especially taking a photo and pasting on it these are just Scare Tactics people get scared and end up paying and they also say if you want to go to court with us it's completely fine a court case will cost multiple lakh rupees so you might as well pay the fine of 15,000 like we agreed on the agreement now once the victim has paid 15,000 rupees we'll think the job is now over and he can run away and start looking for a new job but the scam doesn't end here the scamster calls him again and says hey look back at the contract remember you signed saying you will be employed for 9 months or 11 months so you can't leave right now if you want to leave guess what you've got to pay another 50,000 Rupees I am not making this up look at all of these headlines over here talking about this scam that was scam number one now time for scam number two but this one is slightly different in this one Things become even more complicated and I think a little bit funner too in this situation we have the same victim he looks happy and desperately wants money so the first thing he gets he gets a message and the message says hello there do you want to earn money if you do all you have to do is take screenshots and like YouTube videos for every life will give you 50 rupees so a little confused he says TI let me like three videos take the screenshot and send it in the group The scamster say can you give me your UPI ID and he scammed no he actually receives 150 rupees for doing this simple task yes now he thinks he has a source of income a place to make all of his family proud he inquires further thank you I will worked very hard for this but I don't want 150 rupees I want 15,000 what should I do this is uh you know very difficult I'm a hard worker the scamster says no worries for Hustlers like you we have a new group click here and join the group the victim joins the group and over here there are 20 members and this Hustlers group promises lots of riches but of course the victim is a little SC itical until he sees messages the messages are real screenshots of bank accounts receiving cash from 50,000 to 2 lakh rupees people celebrating partying happy thanking the admin for spreading wealth and knowledge of this secret cave which he is now a part of he is totally aamit this builds a lot of confidence obviously because other people are just like him they're also hustling so he says okay how do I begin my journey the admin says it's simple click on this link here's a username and password and login on a website he does that and sees a beautiful crypto platform the UI is shiny it looks beautiful the data is moving in real time and he says now I think I found my treasure and he deposits 5,000 rup in the account and the admin says buy these two cryptos and sell them he does this it takes a full day but he's at it and he earns 1,000 rupees just like that he thanks the admin goes back to the group sends a screenshot and says I'm still new here it's only 1,000 but I will reach lacks of rupees thank you thank you thank you but the scam is just getting started you see his confidence his chest is coming out he's looking up he looks like he can do this and he deposits 10,000 rupees all the money he's ever earned and does the same thing and earns another 5,000 bucks and finally he tells all his friends borrows money from them his family borrows cash from them and deposits 5 lakh rupees come on this is it game face on the victim this time loses the money it's a little scary the heart pounds people in the group say it's okay you're a businessman it's it's fine he says it's fine I will recover the money he lost this time but it's okay the admin says trust me I've been doing this for a long time I care for you after all you've earned before us it's okay this time he borrows a little bit more money and deposits 10 lakhs his heart is pounding but all of his friends and the telegram group say it's okay by we'll be fine and he starts to trade the markets are moving he loses a little bit but he knows it's going to go up and this time it's gone he's lost he says now what there surely must be a way I mean he can't lose all this money he's borrowed it from people and he's a he's a hard worker so he asks the admin he asked the admin the admin is blocked him and he goes to the website the website doesn't exist he just got scammed this scam is called the bait and the bait simply means that they will win your trust using testimonials and money before they scam you for the real amount so I guess the scamsters do invest some money to earn a big amount so recalling this entire scam when he was invited and he made that 150 rupees that's the bait do something super simple send a screenshot and 150 is sent after that the 150 he earned he got a bit of confidence and said I have got real 150 cash this looks legit he joins the group now that group of 20 people all the other 19 was scamsters all those screenshots everything was there to build hype for him and he looked at other people thinking it works and you'll also notice he didn't add money to the actual website if you saw the screenshot properly he sent the money to be added to the account to the admin to a savings bank account in it's not a real application he just sent money to someone and again the bait was such that he sent back some profits again increasing his confidence but now in the thousands and finally when he deposits a large amount that's taken away by the scamsters but you know what the scam doesn't end here cuz you don't have a checklist so what I'm going to do is I'm going to give you and your friends a checklist so you don't fall for these frauds anymore [Music] so in checklist the first one is very simple thoroughly check the website you don't just want a pretty looking UI to actually build you confidence you have to see their contact info does it exist do you know their telephone numbers the address verify it on other websites whether it's actually true or not also check out websites like consumer complaints Etc to see if any people have complained against this company n m the second point in the checklist is two good to be true I mean think about it you'll type for 15 minutes or an hour or two and earn 20,000 rupees really I mean anything that's too good to be true especially on the internet probably isn't number three no qualification check if this is a part-time job shouldn't there be an interview process shouldn't they be checking documents shouldn't they be actually around to make sure that you're the right candidate how did you start the job so easily as a p of course not something's wrong here number four upfront money if you're going for employment whether parttime or full-time your job is to work not give them money to join them if some company asks for upfront money don't do that that's a red flag and checklist number five before you sign anything please read it are they asking for things that could take undue advantage of you don't just sign it just like that read through it no matter how many pages we've been trying to De influence for a while now and have covered a lot of scams if this has ever happened to you tell me in the comments below and see you in the next episode",

cafe it's here come check this out here scene bro scene such a Vibe [Music] Vibe welcome please [Music] please selling 20 rupees coffee for 200 doesn't make money if you're selling it to just one person I mean who's going to take care of the cost I have fixed cost staff all of this I mean where's the money going to come from valuation don't get me started on valuation I mean I thought a nice place good looks great menu will take care of it but investors they said something else completely I mean I don't understand it what they really want maybe maybe I'm not cut out for this sir coffee for you H something was definitely wrong here I mean there's nothing wrong with the business there are a bunch of customers it seems all right something is wrong with this Founder's expectation so we thought we should actually de influence this and we're not de influencing normal small businesses or large businesses we're de influencing the expectations of people wanting to run a startup with super high valuations and make you look at your Instagram and say my life sucks so without further Ado we'll talk about the good the bad and you know what the media won't tell you the truth so let's [Music] begin so why is this mental shift happening from jobs to startups I mean think about it 20 years ago we didn't have any investors no VCS no no startups no valuation we just had a job but then Flipkart and Ola came some time back and changed the Indian landscape they got foreign investors scaled very quickly basically made starting dunda sexy 20 years ago if you thought about a businessman you'd think a guy in a safari suit would go to his Factory come back not really glamorous but Founders today are glamorous think about the impression of a startup founder now he's on the cover of magazines he raises millions of dollars people adore him he has so many employees and it seems like his business is doing fantastically well so the mental shift on the Internet is maybe I shouldn't do a job maybe I should just start a company and become this glamorous person that I always wanted to be in fact you can even see it in the data from a few hundred startups we've gone to tens of thousands almost 73,000 registered in 2022 so why don't we talk about the myths and the expectations let's start with myth number one you are your own boss which means you can come in whenever you feel like you can sleep in the afternoon Take 2 hour long lunch breaks if you don't feel like working today it's fine you are the boss there's no kpi no kras no one to report to you lead the life you feel like this is completely wrong when you're running a business you have to do everything you are the salesperson the receptionist the designer the coder the person looking at the customers taking care of them also offering refunds fighting with vendors also hiring people your role in the startup is everyone and you go from 9 to5 to 24/7 in fact there was a study where they surveyed the mental health of Founders and it's pretty crappy I've been running companies for 10 years now this company is the fifth and I have to tell you A lot of the times I have to walk in the office with a smile because if I don't other people will get upset and scared and this is also part of my job I am the lead cheerleaders mix number two Founders earn a lot of money cuz they are the owners of course they're worth billions of dollars have a private jet a nice car I mean we've seen all those photos on the internet but that's a wrong expectation the reality is quite different most Founders take a pay cut when they join now when you start startup and let's say you raise some money the investor does not want you to take a high salary because you need to be aligned with the investor you own equity and so does the investor you need to grow the business to increase the valuation so the short-term cash flow doesn't matter the long-term business matters I too have been running companies for a really long time and this is the fifth the fourth company at the highest peak I was taking home 3 lakh rupees a month which was a lot of money even back then but when we shut that down for whatever reason and started this company I had to start with 60,000 Rupees for the first couple of years now I don't think Founders need sympathy over here that's what they've signed up for my point is all founders have the exact same Journey so if you want to earn millions of dollars with your startup think again it won't happen in the first five 6 years it may happen in the first 10 years 15 or even 20 years and this is completely normal Equity that's just how it grows myth number three you'll be able to raise tons of money and once you have tons of money it solves all your issues you can run ads you'll be able to hire a team millions of dollars in account which means you also make some cash you will also be able to get the insights from the actual investors because they have so much experience and network in fact starting a company the goal is to raise millions of dollars this cannot be further from the truth I probably could talk about this for 30 minutes but I'll do it really quickly one the money that comes is not yours nothing goes to the founder it goes to the company to run the business rent your office hire the right people money usually doesn't solve anything imagine the problems a lot of money boots one you cannot solve culture and retention you cannot attract a lot of good talent for a long period of time because that is money IGN tic people want a nice place to work place that they can grow etc etc you start making PPS and projections and starting new lines of business losing focus in your main business spread to thin and one day you find out that because you didn't have Focus none of the businesses are working too much money is actually not a good thing now let's talk about raising a lot of money then selling the business for a lot of money and earning well a lot of money it's something called liquidation preference so let's suppose an investor agrees to invest 50 CR rupees in your business and the business is valued at 100 crores now let's say he owns 50% and you own 50% now say for whatever reason something happens and you sell the business for 50 CR rupees so you're selling it at half of what you originally valued it at but it's okay 50 cror is a lot of money right yes yes 50 crores is a lot and you own 50% so you should get 25 crores but with the liquidation preference stack the founder in this case makes nothing because the original 50 CR that was invested first goes to the investor and whatever was left which in this case is nothing nothing goes to the founder this means every time a Founder raises money at higher valuation the risk is exponentially increasing for him as well I'm not saying this is bad you should just know that this exists in fact when startups raise money from institutional investors there are a bunch of VC terms that most Founders agree to if you'd love for us to do a video on it tell me in the comments if we get 50 likes we will do an entire episode on it let's move to the next myth now let's come to myth number four Fame on LinkedIn you'll put founder and CEO on the internet people will know you as a Founder you'll go on different podcasts and say yeah I didn't have money now you know the business is doing pretty well all these things will happen you might even get on the cover and all those Atia who said you won't be able to do anything in life will say wow this guy is awesome the reality is quite different all the famous Founders you see are doing it to actually help their business if your Fame is public your meltdowns are public too the media is also a horrible industry when you raise money they will plaster it all across the headlines because they get clicks and when the startup doesn't do well they will equally go after you with a pitch for saying what a bad founder come on guys running a business is hard and the media makes it worse but there's another reality too in the last many years of running businesses I've met famous people not so famous people billionaires Millionaires and I've noticed a lot of people who have a lot of money aren't famous and a lot of people who are super famous have absolutely no money so Fame and money may not have a direct connection they're two different Journeys and you should select them just because you're successful doesn't mean you'll be famous and vice versa myth number five all you need is a unique idea come here let me tell you a secret last night I was thinking about this new startup idea where oh someone's already done it have you ever felt that that you're discussing something with a friend or thinking in the shower and after a few days you see the exact same product and you say I had thought about the exact same thing if you had write down the product in the comments below and at that point you feel if I had money some time and one of these things I would have been able to run that successful startup because the idea came to me always and the reason this happens is that you actually got 10,000 ideas there are a billion people in the country each with a billion ideas and someone is going to execute something because we're all thinking the same things ideas are worth exactly zero rupees exec ution is worth everything and when you actually want to build a startup you have to have all these different things work out for you the industry should be growing you have to have the right people right time right place enough Capital Focus only build stuff that people will use product Market fit distribution run the company operations the list goes on and on so that's why if you do it for a long time kabby kabi luckily all these planets align and things work out the idea has zero value this is why one of the biggest skill skills of starting and running a business is never giving up because everything wrong will happen but you have to keep going dancing to your own tune for decades and one day you might hit it big so in conclusion running a small business or a large business or a highflying valuation business is not wrong the only wrong is your expectation and I hope this video gave you the right expectations and you can go in the path you want you should ask yourself what do you want from your life what do you want from the next 5 years and pick that part I'll take placement oh yeah okay guys placement [Laughter] today we're going to talk about trends",

    "transcript_full": "what's the first question yeah a question one so this person says I need higher CTC cuz I'm not able to save what should I do this guy needs higher CTC because he okay do you agree with this of course more salary is good yes are his friend must be earning more maybe someone from his family is earning more so higher CTC means higher savings I mean he's asking not so you mean if you get a higher CTC that's a good solution for your Financial Health correct you'll be able to save more okay and if I tell you that how you can actually make with a higher CTC and make a good life then this problem is solved solved okay let's do a little bit of philosophy okay let's imagine two people okay RAM and Sham now sham over here earns 1 lakh rupees in hand a month Ram earns 50,000 in hand a month who's winning rah Sham this is Ram correct sham sh's winning so sham is earning 2x of this guy and this is how we feel right correct all of us feel like R but let's turn this a little bit these guys want to live a nice life in the future 5 or 10 years from now 10 years you want to live a good life in the future comfortable life very okay so now let's imagine this guy who's earning 1 lak a month is saving 5,000 rupes but he gets his bag he can travel he gets nice places sneakers all of those things but this guy is pretty happy with his life he likes reading staying at home ET Etc and he saves 40,000 rupes a month personal choice okay so he says 5,000 he says 40,000 both of them are investing over a period of 10 years what's the difference going to be assuming that they're earning a little bit every year what's going to happen he'll save more no he'll save more but he earned more so what's going to be but he's investing more correct what do you think is going to be this guy's final number would you be surprised that this guy is closer to 10 lakhs around 10 lakhs in 10 years okay not including taxes this guy is closer to 80 85 lakhs almost a COR if he does it a few more years he'll touch a COR even at that 50,000 salary growing at only 10% a year we only compare ourselves to our active income but active income isn't the only way to grow Rich it's also the choices you make you have to choose do you want to live a life of huge abundance today and then have some issues in the future because it's uncertain be balanced no should be balanced now this guy saved 80% maybe that's too much but can you save more than 5% cuz that's too low if you can save more you can get ahead of everyone and this anxiety CTC it's not about the CTC it's about what you do with the money that's remaining and how you invest it next question question number two how do I manage my emis credit card credit cards it's very simple now move all your emis to your credit card use your credit card to pay your emis why do you use a cred credit card in the first place low cost emis discounts cash back Reward Points etc etc okay so basically you use your credit card because it gives you reward points you're saving money but the problem is that cash back cash back yeah cash back but the problem is that you have so many emis you don't know how to manage it right so if I tell you how to manage it the problem is solved correct and I'll be able to say he'll be able to save more money right sure so let's imagine that U this is your budget for your uh trip that you have put on credit card it's a leaf it's Pony Leaf imagine it's your budget so now what's your budget can you see your budget yeah that's your budget you know your budget the problem with the credit card is this is your budget can you see the budget it's theoretically unlimited because your credit card might have 2 lakh 5 lakh 10 lakh a limit and the money never leaves your account so it feels like you can spend as much as you want but the problem happens when you you start getting these emis so I'm able to pay you can't because you don't have it I don't pay you enough the person the user sir sure I am getting enough the problem is this if you don't know how much you're spending you will always overspend right it's like if you did not have the sense of knowing your tummy is full you'll keep eating your body knows it's full it tells you it's full so you stop eating but credit card is quite the opposite and the Emi happen the next month so you forget about it for a complete month and you take a new Emi and the Emi just keeps rolling so the simple solution to this you already know you have to have a budget you should know I'm going to spend 10,000 a month on emis and not cross it put this in an Excel sheet or do what I do as soon as I get my salary from the company of course salary I take a portion of my earning and put it in a debt fund a liquid fund and that is my Emi fund because I take a lot of trips that's how I save my money and put it in one fund so I know this is my budget so as soon as I spend it on the credit card if I use a credit card I take it out from that fund pay the entire thing so I use the credit card like a debit card so I can't buy anything that's right that's what's the point of living that's the definition of affordability if you can't afford it then you can't buy it you can't afford it so question number three so he's asking uh how can I learn new skills to earn extra income s uh new extra income yeah new skills to earn extra income okay yes so I think the question is how do I earn a new skill so I can earn a better income this could be more income maybe so this could be that maybe you get a better promotion in this in the office you're working at it could be you want to start a business it could be some way that you earn an extra income correct correct if I'm earning 10 so how can I make it 12 okay what extra skills require so basically everyone earns because of skills the problem is and we spoke about t-shaped skills before you should check out that video where we did and t-shape basically means this you're always paid more for cross skills that are beyond what your job is within your industry there'll be other um parts so for example the tech team in our company um only doesn't learn about front end the front- end developer also wants to learn infrastructure infrastructure is that server thing right so if they don't understand these extra things then their income doesn't increase because when you bring two disciplines together that's when you create a unique situation for yourself to earn more money so very simply instead of spending your a weekend on other things you should pick a skill within your domain and try to master it I mean everywhere it's not like our company is there a shortcut no no you just do this for a really long period of time and eventually you will find yourself as a new skill set and that's what earns you the income even this compounds just like your money what's the next question yeah just a second I'm finding okay so this person says I am starting investing okay but tell me some crypto or small cap crypto or small cap hey crypto sir two profit very high very quick high and what about small cap why small cap because it will give me more money boom okay this is a really more money this is a really good question I think the answer is very simple you have to follow a sequence the first and the most important thing is not growth it's not growth it's not growth it's safe in a worst case scenario you should be all right create your emergency fund okay which is 6 months of your expenses total expenses yes I know so figure out your 6 months of your expenses put it in a fixed deposit liquid fund whatever you like but put it away this is to be used in case of an emergency once you've done this The Next Step walk with me is your health insurance health is wealth so if to get your health insurance and for you and your family to make sure you're covered correct very important Next Step take another step with me is going to be life insurance not bad you already know it I have it so if something happens to you then your family is okay got it perfect and then your next step is going to be Investments that's right small cap no crypto no sequence over here you want to invest in an index fund or some kind of mutual fund if you're really really new that's a great place to start correct is if you have some money left some money left no then you can think about learning how to analyze stocks pick stocks Etc but most people can just stop here but if you really want to do it then maybe you can come here not bad not bad then you can explore highly risky asset but I would say just stop here so this sequence is really important first safety then growth because if you don't feel secure you will never grow because growth mindset is an aggressive mindset and if you lose something and you lose confidence you've lost everything does that useful correct I hope that answered your question I hope it did and we're listening to every single question and this guy's disturbing me on a Sunday to answer your questions so 01 Community please post more questions on our Instagram and everywhere else to see what we can do and also one more thing before you ask me that last question I have a mission for you Z1 Community you take a selfie or a photo of yourself put it up on Instagram and tell us what you did to start your financial security Journey if we like your story we'll feature it on Instagram and we'll also send you some merch cool what did you do so I'm getting late now one last last question last question wait wait wait help me I'll do it one last question so this person says this person says how do I stay consistent with my plan financial plan that's actually a good question how do you stay consistent with your plan yeah so I think the first thing is how do you build a house I don't know you tell me you you lay the first brick then you lay the second brick and soon the house is built so there is no hack for this guys as soon as you start investing you have to force yourself to do this every single month the moment you start thinking about year five year 10 and all of us do it I'm sorry think about the next month and the next investment bus and soon you'll be fine so that's the way to do it",

    "transcript_full": "newspapers and online articles are flooded with Traders claiming to have made so much money all they need to do is sit down do a bunch of Jing bong and make a lot of cash and I know you feel if they can do it why can't I but the truth can be really different I've been trading for a while now so I'll give you an honest perspective on whether intraday trading can actually make money or not so there's nothing wrong with intraday trading and it's not that nobody makes money from intraday trading but I think the expectations is a little crazy on the internet so before we delve there let's first understand what's intraday trading what are the expectations versus reality and then talk about if it's possible or not and we'll also talk about situations where it's actually profitable so let's start with the first thing what is intraday trading intraday as the name suggests is intraday as in within the day markets open at 9:15 a.m. and close at 330 which means you take a trade let's say you buy a stock at 100 rupees and then the market appreciates that stock goes to 110 you exit that stock before the day ends so it's intraday and you make a 10 Rupees profit now the cool thing is if you had 1,000 shares that you traded with you made 10,000 rupees before brokerage taxes and all the other things in just a few hours another interesting thing you can do when you intraday trade is that you can profit if the market Falls and we'll talk about this later but the point is that a lot of influencers online nowadays are making it look that intraday is an easy way to make millions of rupees but the reality is completely different so why do people like intraday trading and they're tempted to actually try it let's talk about the expectations that the internet will set for you for intraday trading the first expectation set is low Capital let me explain with a small amount of money you'll be able to control a large amount of stock and because of this your profit will also be larger so if you are just an investor the problem is if you invest in say a fixed deposit it will give you 7% a year that doesn't sound too interesting if you invest in stocks as we've explained before you have to compound it for 5 years 7 years 10 years that's also boring but with intraday something interesting can happen you will look at it and it will feel like you can make a lot of money with a small amount of capital and let me show this to you with an actual example this is daber now first let's look at it from the perspective of a long-term investment this is not investment advice I'm just trying to show you what long-term versus intraday looks like and also why intraday is a problem so in D the stock is trading at about 650 rupe so let me do one thing let me show you the funds in my account I have 12,7 rupees in my account right now which means I can only buy 12,000 rupees worth of shares for the long term so let's see what that looks like I will open dber shares I'll open the buy so this buy order basically shows that I'm going to buy dber on this exchange it's one quantity and the amount is $650 three amount is like you guessed you pay this to get one share of dber so since I have 12,000 let me change this to say I guess 15 and uh refresh it and I'll see that it shows 9,800 9,800 I have 9,800 that means for the long term I can spend 9,800 and buy this stock for a longterm investment but now let me switch from long-term to Mis and Mis means intraday let's see what happens and keep your eye on that amount area which says 9,800 right now so I'll change it to intraday see that it's become 1,900 so let me get this straight if I want to invest long-term 15 shares all I can buy but if I want to intraday trade 15 shares only costs me or requires a margin of 1,961 This Means since I have 12,000 rupees I can can trade with more right so let me change this to 90 okay 90 quantity so 90 shares if I trade I will require 11,746 which otherwise would have required a lot more money for an investor but for a Trader instead of trading just 15 I can trade with 90 which means my profit will also be larger and so will my losses but it doesn't matter Traders especially beginners are big optimist so let me place an order and actually buy this stock I place this order and I'm going to the order window and I can see the dber has been placed and you can see why this leverage increases your profit multifold if the market goes on your side but you know what that is precisely the problem if this stock Falls by just 1% and I am 10 times leveraged I will lose 10 times me more just because your broker allows you leverage doesn't mean you should use it Leverage is a double-edged sword that beginner should not touch now imagine this on one side if you had taken a long-term investment with 15 shares and on the other side you had done this intraday trade with 90 shares and let's say darber moved up in our favor by 10 Rupees in just a few minutes 10 rupes multiplied by 90 would be 900 rupes profit in in just a few minutes and over here it would be just 150 rupe so you can see clearly why people think less time less Capital very exciting very spicy boring compounding old people do this the difference is massive people think that they can make small amounts of money really quickly but imagine if just the opposite happened it fell 20 30 40 rupees what would happen to this trade also imagine that you were doing this with a larger Capital like 1 lakh or 2 lakh could you really lose 10% 20% in just a few minutes the answer is yes you could the second expectation that you'll be sold on the internet and by all these people is guaranteed returns now here how this story goes people will say if the market goes up an intraday Trader can make money if the market goes down through something called Short Selling and intraday Trader can make money if markets fall too now I remember around 2008 or 9 I met this one uncle and he said beta I think you know if you learn a little bit of analysis trading can be very simple I said okay Uncle what's your point he said very simple I know that this company moves 10 Rupees every day I've been watching it for a while every day it moves 10 Rupees with some Capital that I have I'll buy 1,000 shares whether I go long or short doesn't matter because move as soon as it moves 1 rupee in my favor I'll exit and make 1,000 rupees and I'll do this a few times in the day and I'll walk with 5 to 6,000 rupees a day I am a simple man I just need 5 6K a day times 20 days I'll trade I'll make some money I'm happy that's my strategy that's not a strategy that's a bankruptcy plan and I'll explain how one the costs of trading are more than you think you will pay government tax if you make a profit you'll pay income tax if you enter you have to pay transaction taxes so your entry if it's at 100 it's not 100 it's 100 plus expenses which means that the market needs to move a little more in your favor now for you to make that profit third you have to predict the D ction of the market now we always imagine the markets are going sideways all the time and we will make 1 one1 1,000 rupees and it'll add up to a lack by the end of the month this does not happen here is what's actually going to happen you will take a long trade you will wait for 1 Rupees to go up for you to make that 1,000 but that day the market will reverse and fall 30 rupes and you will lose 30,000 rupe you will do this again and lose another 30 ,000 rupes wiping away any gains that you made before that yes I said gains it's possible for you to make money sometimes when you do this but 1 2 three bad trades will wipe away everything and take away that Capital 2 so now let's come to point number three the magic strategy basically you will get one strategy online or you can read a book and you'll feel like you figured something out let me show you an example of what a strategy looks like so what I'm going to do is I'm going to open a 10-minute chart of dber choosing this stock completely randomly and I've added the magic moving average over here this magic moving average is orange in color and it's a 100 moving average what it is is it's tracking the average movement of daber over the last 100 bars each bar is 10 minutes long now all you need to do is look at it whenever the price comes close to the the orange line after some time it bounces back see over here it's bounced back over here it's bounced back over here it's bounced back over here it's bounced back so all you need to do is track when the market comes close to this then once it starts moving up you buy it and you'll make money on the way up like look at this over here on this day from the orange line all the way here the market moved up a full 2% but let's look at it a little closer here you'll notice the market came down down you would have bought it here but the market fell completely now you'll think that the market went up but it's intraday actually the day ended so you would have had to close your position and the market well gave you a loss so this would have been a loss trade the market gapped up went all the way up there was no way for you for you to enter because it just moved very quickly and you missed the entire move the same thing happens again and again until you see a sideways Market the market touch is the orange line what multiple times during the day you would have tried to enter multiple times and gotten nowhere so looking at this strategy from afar looks really good but executing it intraday changes a lot of things the market can just Gap up it can Gap Down News will affect it but the amazing thing about a magic strategy is it will always feel like if you make money you'll feel like a king and if you lose money it'll feel like you just didn't analyze enough maybe if you add one more rule one more technicality next time you'll be able to catch the trend the final expectation is probability if you understand this you'll understand the entire game of money now you'll think a Trader a successful Trader probably makes money 9 out of 10 times this is not true most Traders make money 50/50 or 40 60 which means 40 trades make money 60 trades lose money so that's 1 2 3 4 and they lose the rest of the times it could also be that they're making money only three times out of 10 but the difference is when they make money they make a little more than how much they actually lose and just that difference of how much they make makes all the difference and this is called a risk reward ratio so they make a little more money then they lose so 1 is to two or 1 is to three is quite common but that difference is how they actually make cash now understand this in trading you have to take multiple trades and be right many many times and every time you write you'll accumulate that into a profit now let's compare this to say Warren Buffett's portfolio War bit's portfolio is very different he may have a worse loss rate than this he would have probably invested in many many stocks over his entire lifetime but a few of these stocks earned him all this money just like that so what's the bottom line can you make money from Trading the answer is yes just like any other profession if you spend loads of money time effort to figure it out of course you can all these hedge funds over here actually make money from Trading but they don't approach it as a getrich scheme they treat it as a business mathematics ially figure out how the market works and make money over a period of time [Music]",

    "title_current": "Why are Weddings in India CRAZY EXPENSIVE!",
    "transcript_full": "just in the last two years the average cost of an Indian wedding has gone from 25 lakhs to 36 lakhs why why are Indian weddings getting so expensive so let's understand the scale of weddings happening throughout the country there are one cor weddings happening every year in India one CR and most of them happen in November and December and people will spend up to 20% of their lifetime earn earning on this one event and we also know that a Shadi costs on average 28 lakh rupees but we also know that the average household income in India less than 5% actually earn 30 lakh rupees which means if you put everyone's income together a household less than 5% of the country earns this amount but they're spending so much every year clearly they're spending for a different reason and that's status a lot of people can't afford these weddings but they try to go out of their way to actually show how highly they can be placed in society so the drive over here is very interesting it's status and money and how they're feeding off of each other to actually make things really expensive in the wedding state but you know it wasn't always the case in the 1960s something really interesting happened the government introduced the guest control order which meant that you can't have more than 25 people at a wedding now I'm serious you can't have more than 25 people at a single wedding because the situation in the country was Grim there was a war happening on one side and India's inflation had skyrocketed to 18% so to actually reduce consumption and because the Indian government knew that weddings are a place where Indians Splurge they reduced and restricted the guest list to be only 25 people but how did we go from a 25 person event to wedding so Grand so lavish that it's so expensive you don't want to know the price tag something happened in 1991 which fundamentally changed Indian Society forever India got liberalized which means it opened itself to the world foreign companies entered and we had a giant race to the top the race was who can spend more household spending went through the roof went up 10 times in the last 30 years at that point and people started to buy stuff now I want you to think when people want to buy stuff outside of Roy CA Maan what would they buy so one thing's clear income in India was going up and if you look at this chart here you can see that lower income groups were moving to Middle inome groups and the middle income groups were moving to Upper Middle income groups now think about it from a population level that the number of middle inome people has increased exponentially in in fact the population went from around 800 million to 1.44 billion so what do you think will fundamentally change in society status how do you show everyone around you that you have moved from here to here when the car the house the jewelry isn't enough you look towards weddings that's why weddings became this Grand spectacle to show wealth power prosperity and whatnot and the market is really big because more than 65% of our country has a really young population which means more people will get married every year around the same months which means a lot of candidates want to get married so the demand side of this equation is really really high and like we've already seen the cultural pressure is this I have to show that I've made it so parents will spend big on a wedding but something is still unsolved in 2022 the average wedding cost 25 lakhs all right but in 2020 4 it's about 36 lakhs why did the prices go up so much in Just 2 years there must be something else right it can't be the GDP and household income there must be something that we're completely missing and you can see right from banquet hall to all the food the prices and demand is still going up in fact these vendors claim that when they know there is a wedding they will charge a wedding markup for example if you want a tent for a non-wedding occasion the price is this but a tent for a wedding occasion will cost you this they will always charge more for the same exact product or service but if it's in a wedding but think about it when you spend on a wedding it has a multiplication effect on the actual economy like the vendor that you hire will spend on raw materials the Jeweler that you hire to make the jewelry will hire labor will buy raw materials the people who earn from those vendors will then again spend in the economy creating a multiply effect which means you're not just spending on a single event you're also increasing the economy's size from 2022 to 2024 why did the expenditure and weddings go up so much the answer is with your neighbor actually it's with s SOC show off culture for your parents it was the big PARTA in those movies and for you it's on Instagram these movies your parents watched and you probably also enjoyed told you that Family Life Family Values love and togetherness so close to Indian culture is closely related to Celebration and dancing and Grand weddings where everyone is having a Gala time and this is what success actually means as a family which is really Indian and maybe why Indians are brainwashed to actually spend so much on weddings even if they can't afford it think about it the last time you went for a wedding there was a s there was a Bollywood dance where did that influence come from it came from movies but us as kids or our parents used to watch a movie once a month and it was such a glorious time but now all I need to do is take my phone out unlock it and hit the magic button Instagram and there's a mini one minute movie playing all the time and I can just flip through it this means the effect of media on our rains isn't happening once a month but once every time we bored which happens a lot during the day so I'm always watching reals and then a and 10 hours later for example Anushka Sharma got married and spent about 6 to 7 lakh rupees on this langa but the same langa is available in delhi's Chi chalk for about 80,000 to1 lak the first copy and this brings us to an actual Trend across the country where you can buy buy first or second copies of famous influencers or actors and actresses and use it at your special day now the cost of the langa isn't determined by the quality wearability or the beauty of the langa itself it's determined by the aspiration that you too want to have a fairy tale wedding just like your favorite actor Anushka Sharma and this trend is happening in markets across the country not only in clothes but even hairstyle beauty makeup the food you want the the decoration you name it Instagram is telling you what kind of wedding you should have to keep you happy now the Gap is between what you want and what you can actually afford and what you can actually afford is something that does not make you happy what you can't afford what you see on the internet is what should make you happy and this Gap is filled by a new magic and this magic is called credit the India lens wedding report talks about how 26% of couples want to self-fund their own weddings of that 68% plan to borrow between 1 and 5 lakh rupees now because you're taking a loan which is not asset backed it's for an event the interest is between 99.99% all the way to 24% now this is bad because you're not creating an asset and you're still paying interest now let's say you take a 5 lakh rupe loan at 15% a year you will end up paying 7 lakh rupees including the interest in fact postco the home loan growth rate has actually decreased and the personal loan growth rate has increased which means people are actually taking loans for stuff that doesn't build assets they build stuff for conspicuous consumption which is the worst kind of consumption because it's not building anything apart from maybe reputation status and to be honest some really nice memories but you got to build assets too right now we can do do all the analysis in the world but the truth is that a wedding is an emotional decision and there is only one way you can actually bring the cost down by actually watching this video",

    "title_current": "Credit Cards are WORST for Indians",
    "transcript_full": "Sir, I'm not able to buy my new house. My credit score is low. Banks are charging very high interest. God, what loans do you have running right now? Sir, if you can give me double appraisal. What are your current loans? Zero loans. I just have credit cards. Credit card? You're obviously not paying on time. I knew it you were going to say this. I have created this tracker. I have all of my payments written here. Okay, that's good. Now, show me your home loan calculation. The interest rate is very high. So I can actually help you save some money on this loan and therefore I will not increase your salary. If you're not able to save then double appraisal. Okay. Three questions and 11 lakhs I will save. If I'm able to do it no appraisal. Okay. Question number one. Yes sir. Do you pay your credit card bills every month? Yes. Full payment. I make full payment. Minimum payment. Keep full payment. Yes sir. All payment done. Let's say you have 30,000 rupees balance that you have due pay full 30,000 or pay the minimum due which is let's say 1 1500 you choose the smaller number or the larger number smaller number always sometimes sometimes right so here's the problem when we paying a credit card bill we think if we pay the minimum payment we've made some payment but no you're supposed to make the full 30,000 payment let me show you something magical here I'm damn sure you didn't know this this is a Excel sheet. It shows the opening balance right now is 30,000 which means you owe 30,000 to the credit card company. Cool. Done. All right. And then we can see there is interest. There's minimum payment principle and closing balance. Now we want this closing balance to be zero. Yes. And there is a minimum payment. Let's assume we pay just the minimum payment every single month for 12 months. No expenses in the upcoming months and no other expenses. Just so we can assuming assuming. Okay. Just so we can calculate this 30,000. Did you know this 3 12% interest rate is actually 42% yearly interest rate and then over the 12 months you'll actually pay roughly 16,600 on 30,000 on 30,000 and your actual 30,000 will only reduce by 5,000. So basically thees are you owed you paid 16,600 but actually only 5,000 was removed from 30,000. that 30K becomes 25K and the rest I think 11,000 something went all to interest so I should make full payments you have to make full payments because every time you pay minimum due you're paying 42% yearly in interest sir I have a question so the amount is 30,000 okay I mean I don't have it up right so what should I do um okay actually there's one thing you can do um you can convert this into an EMI. Yeah. So you convert it into a 6 month or 12 month EMI and because it's divided and you're showing intention to the company that hey I'm going to pay back as this schedule then it goes from 42% to like a much lesser number. I think over here it shows like 18%. Which is still really high by the way and this will improve my credit score if you pay on time. Yes. You want to see an example? Let me show you. So let's assume 5,000 is the amount. There'll be a processing fee. There'll be an interest rate of the 18%. I said the EMI will be 878 rupees. This is to this is to I can give and duration is 6 months and the total interest is 266 rupees. So look at 5,000 at 42%. 5,000 at 18%. Look at the difference in interest you're paying. So after if I do this I'll be able to buy my house. Why don't you focus on your skill so you can earn more and then why are you always I want to buy this. I want to buy this. I don't want to buy the email. [Music] Okay. H second question. Why the hell are you spending so much money every single month? What is all this? Why two phones? So, oh no, no, no. That's not me. That's my friend. And this is Pulkit. This is Bratis. This is Nisha. So, whenever they need help, I'm always there for my friends. So, I just give them my credit card. But no, there's a problem here. You're not following the credit utilization ratio because it's so high. your actually score will come down. So that's the problem. I know. I know. Okay. So let's imagine that this is your credit limit. Very s I have enough credit limit. Yeah. This is your credit limit and you are using say most of it 70 80%. Okay. This means you're overextending yourself. Maybe you're not earning is not good. So the bank doesn't see it as a good thing. You want whatever your limit is you want to use only 30 40% of it. Sir I have a credit card this limit is let's say charl help me understand this in that context so one situation uh you are under 40% so 40% of four lakhs is 1.6 lakhs okay you've not spent more than 1.6 six lakhs on the card you're fine to my credit score is safe. Yeah. In this case of course credit utilization uh criteria it's safe. Uh case two and let's take an extreme case you use the entire credit limit. So full lak off entire fax. Okay. What you can do is that before the billing cycle starts off you pay off your loan char. I mean you shouldn't take the loan in that case if you can't pay it. If you pay it off before the bill is generated, it will not reflect to the credit bureaus. Oh, so even if I use 80% before the bill generation, I should pay it off. Yeah, but please don't do that. But example, you do all these things, time will go by, time will go by, your credit score will improve. Will it happen tomorrow? No, nothing happens tomorrow. Everything takes time. Now, let's move to the third question. Hey, I I know one hack. I know one hack. Okay, listen to me. I will take two more credit cards. Huh? That will increase my credit limit and utilization. Wow. That is reality. I have one card only because you are not financially disciplined. If you seem very credit hungry to the banks and you're taking multiple cards, when you actually go to the bank for a new card or a new loan or whatever, they'll perform something called a hard check. And when they do that to check, they'll say, \"Yeah, this person is asking for too many loans.\" And your credit score will actually fall. Isn't the entire point of reduction of your choices to take a loan? So when you add this, your financial discipline will get screwed, right? I've seen a lot of people on the internet say this, just get two more cards. No, if you're not financially disciplined, don't get more cards. And if you're not financially disciplined, get no cards. Okay. So now the third question, right? How do you think and why? Yes, sir. I have one more hack. Just tell me. So I have used my credit card so much. Yes. Yes. I would have accumulated a lot of reward points. Correct. Okay. If I use that, maybe next year I'll save some money. Maybe flight shopping. That will save money. No. How many points do you have? I have. What's the conversion? What kind of card is it? It's a good card. And conversions by you actually getting some value. Show me the card again. Is it written on your Excel sheet? Yeah, it's about the details. It says Okay. Over here it says earn four reward points in every 150 rupees spent. So basically for one lakh spent you'll get about 2,000 reward points. And if you actually do the math that means let's assume you're redeeming a flight booking. Okay. So basically you saved uh 2,000 reward points and if you multiply by.5 you saved 1,000 rupees on the ticket. How do you feel about that? I think your calculation is wrong. No, it's actually my card. It's it it's good. This card and why I chose airline tickets is that this card is a shopping card. So, you can't it the conversion for flight bookings isn't really good. My point is very simple. So, each card specializes in a kind of transaction. So, you have like a travel card for people who are frequent flyers. You have um shopping cards, you have fuel cards for different use cases, right? And then you have to spend it intelligently. Sometimes the cards get devalued. So the value changes, the conversion changes, etc., etc. So if you're blindly just spending in hopes that someday you'll use the reward points, that's not the right way. I have a lot of good friends who know how to use these cards and yes, they fly for free in many cases, but I don't know if you have that much effort to put in. You said I should not get many cards, more cards because that will affect my credit score. Yes, you shouldn't. You said shopping, travel, finance card. I said that is what it's for. So unless you really understand the system, you can't um hope that reward points will make sense for you. You know what I'm saying? Cool. So that's basically it. Thanks so much. Take care. How much money have I saved so far? First, we'll get your credit score. What? Which is 700. Okay. You Why? Why is the question? 700. 700. Uhhuh. 700. Loan amount is 1 CR. M interest rate is 9 12%. 20 years your EMI is about 75,000 total repayment 1.78. Okay. Now let's say for the next 2 years you work on improving your credit score. You pay all your credit card bills on time. You keep the utilization ratio below 40%. And your credit score does improve. So this credit score then becomes 750. Huh. Okay. Now the loan amount everything is the same but the interest rate goes from 9 1/2% to 8 1/2%. automatically just go to the bank and say check my credit score please give me a better rate they should offer you between 8 1/2 to 8.75 now I've assumed a slightly better scenario I've assumed 8 1/2% which is quite possible and the loan tenure and everything is the same you'll see here that the change in interest rate of 1% will save you over 11 lakh rupees oh so better behavior actually converts into actual savings now you can use this 10 lakhs somewhere so the problem actually is not with credit cards, it's with humans. Although obviously and when humans aren't following and doing the right things, they actually end up doing stupid things and losing money, which is what you're not supposed to do. Remember, credit cards, loans are actually not bad. You don't understand it. Make sense? I do. I do. Now you do. Yes. So I don't have to give you a appraisal now",

    "title_current": "EXPOSED: Indian School Fees",
    "transcript_full": "The toughest thing about school was getting up in the morning and actually going, not the school prices. But lately, something has changed. This is Ammon. He's 32, planning kids, and he did not go to fancy school, but he wants the best for his kids. But the prices are going insane, which is why we created an Excel sheet just for you to go from nursery all the way to graduation to figure out what does this actually cost, putting the costs you completely forgot. So let's see how much he'll spend even before class one. The common notion was that graduation and post-graduation is really really expensive. But something has actually changed. Take a look at this. The fee structure can be up to 20,000 rupees a month. I myself was really shocked because we saw so many fee structures to understand where the hell is all of this money going. I mean look at this. Uh we have uh fee type, admission fee, processing fee, annual charges, development fee, tuition fee, you know, it's just they can add stuff if they feel like. But one of the heads was hilarious. It said 8,400 rupees for parents orientation. What? So let's add our pre- primary school fee at 2 lak rupees per year. And you can change this according to your area or school preference. But parents think this is the only cost. It's actually not. Now comes other costs. I know that's other costs but no there are other other costs which is transportation, books, uniform. This is roughly 4,167 rupees a month. I know that sounds very specific. Please change it according to what you think you are paying right now. And this becomes about 50,000 rupees a year. And this is not just on the sample size that we saw on a national level. 50% of course fees is spent on these overhead costs. If both parents are working, there's an extra expense that happens which is called daycare. Now comes the moment of truth. We add all these expenses up and we get a yearly cost. But you know what's missing over here? This the F column. Inflation per year. Every price, every expense you know today is the price today and there is an increase every year. So if there's a 3-year period from nursery to KG2, those 3 years you have to include the 10% increase and once you do that you get the future cost column calculated automatically. And for Ammon the total pre primary subtotal before he even begins schooling is a grand almost 12 lakh rupees. I don't have kids and I always eyeballed these numbers but when we actually did the research and it came to close to 11 12 lakhs it blew my socks off. So if you didn't know this please tell me your reaction in the comments. So let's move on to Aman's next leg which is now class one onwards. Aman wants to send his child to a school. There's so many different kinds of schools he can choose from. From government to private to expensive private to very expensive private to very very very very very expensive private you know what I mean right? So he picks the one which he thinks is good and that is about 2.5 lakh rupees a year about 21,000 rupees a month. But you know one thing happens with kids they grow up and when they grow up expense also goes up. From the school's point of view, you see there could be other costs like uh let me read this lab fees, trip fees because they may do an excursion etc. So we need to add those costs as well. So Aman is probably paying around 25,000 rupees a month for school fees. By the way this lab expense thing, right? I mean Nishita's sister who's the writer of this video asked her sister lab school price what's the cost so she sent this message it was psychology lab and then she says lab it was normal school even the kids know that this is just branding so if any's classmates are looking at this and agree from class 1 to 12 I need you to quickly add up all these numbers and in the comments tell me what will be the final cost. But before I tell you actually what the correct answer is, I need to tell you a little bit of a story and I call it the big MIS. You know, you're paying all this money for the best possible education, but the teachers who will actually teach, they're facing a problem. The teacher has two things that she mainly has to do to actually become a good teacher. First, she has to do and second is admin. Daw is deep academic work. And admin is stuff that actually you should hear it from the principal herself who's been doing this for 25 years. Here's what she had to say. So just to list down uh the non-academic responsibilities that the teachers are given. Now every school has so many celebrations, so many events. But what about the teacher? The teacher has to conceptualize the event. She has to make it in such a way that the children really enjoy it. They have to prepare the children for it. Not only that, she has to coordinate. Plus she has to look at the decor also. Earlier days it used to be you know like uniform checking. Check the uniforms, hair is in place or not, shoes are polished or not, nails are clipped or not. But now there is another layer added to it. Check the pockets. The joy of teaching, the reason why she joined this profession that starts taking a backseat slowly. So uh this question has been raised by the parents. You know the fee has hiked by 10%. 8% to 9% would be for the teachers uh salary hike. But it's not that simple. So what happens is that the teachers the salary let's say 40,000 is credited to her account. But before that the school has taken uh you know pre-signed checks from the teachers or the teacher is expected to give back a certain amount of cash as soon as she receives her salary. So this is the cashback scam. >> At the moment based on everyone we've spoken to the school has become a status symbol. If you send them to a nice school with a nice badge, with a nice branding, with all this pearly white gates and very good facilities, you are doing the best for your children. While that is important, I don't think there is any conversation about this stakeholder. And this, my friends, is the big now because the teachers are forced to follow the curriculum and do admin work a little more than actually deep academic work. the parents are forced to send their students somewhere else ladies and gentlemen coaching and we've added this nice little head in the expense column of Ammon and we've included only four years because usually this happens class 9 10 11 and 12 apart from this we have one more expense which is any extracurriculars now this is a buffet it's on the parent and the child pressure and after accounting for inflation and once we add all of this up and the future costs the total is 97.49 lakhs. The power over here is not to scare you is for you to know how to deal with this and we'll talk about that in the third chapter. Right now let's focus on understanding college education. This is pretty simple. Ammon has added tuition, university charges, exam, lab etc at 2.5 lak rupees a year. And then we have living costs like hostel rent, food, travel, devices, deposits. This is another 1.5 lakhs a year. There's college application fees which is roughly 10,000. Then the total comes up to about 1 cr rupees. The total cost table is almost 2 cr rupees. See expense inflation will move and it's going to cost more in the future. You can't do anything about that. You can only do two things that are in your control. Number one, you know that your earning is going to increase over the years and you also know you'll have savings. You'll have some assets. Those assets will grow. Let's bring that into the picture and understand this 2 cr number. Is it affordable or not in the future? First, Aman has to put his total household income. Then we have to assume an annual income growth. As you keep getting a higher salary, the average salary increase is 5 6%. But then you have bonuses and one time there might be spikes and all these events happen over long periods of time. So you can change this expected annual income growth to a normalized number. Then what percentage of annual income is allocated to education. Now remember Aman has other expenses as well. He has rent to pay. He's going to buy a house. He has a car on EMI. He goes out to eat. So he's put 25% over here. Then you have to put the child's current age. If you've not had a kid and the kid is going to be born, you would put a zero. So make sure you change that based on how old your child is. And then we put everything else like age of college start and college end. So now we need to project income and we've already projected costs and if there's a surplus it will show a plus. If there's a deficit, it will show a minus. For Ammon, the deficit comes when the kid is going to college. So how do you actually solve this? So the first step you need to do is actually fill up your numbers and find out what is the shortfall and if there's a surplus then fantastic but um you know there was this period of time in Panchula where my parent my mother was taking care of the house working and teaching English and that's how she paid for our school and everything and we used to walk to school. uh we really really wanted a heroh hawk silver color bicycle. Now mom's salary at that time was I think 10,000 rupees. Now we knew at 8,000 salary or 10,000 salary mom couldn't afford that 2500 or 3,000 rupee bike. It was not possible. One day after almost a year and a half there was a brand new heroh hawk cycle standing in front of the home. To this day, I don't know how she afforded that cycle because mathematically it's not possible. The house rent was 4,000 rupees. But how did she get that cycle? All parents out there, I want to give you a big hug and a big hug to my parents as well because they have done so much to get us to this point. Anyone out there saying, \"I'm a self-made person who's earning well,\" should realize he's standing on the shoulders of his parents who sacrificed all that to get their child to hear. Excel sheets are designed to lie. No Excel sheet is true. You put the numbers, they tell you the shortfall, but they tell you that you're not doing enough. Now, you need to decide what that enough is. So today I'm not going to say take this money put it in index fund put it in gold and today I want you to know what that shortfall is look at that every day for the next 10 days and I promise you in the next few years you'll figure this out and do better. Tell me what you think. See you in the next",

    "transcript_full": "In a country where the average salary is 20,000 to 25,000 rupees, how can Apple, an Uber premium brand, able to sell 12 million phones? I mean, people in the office are willing to spend four times their actual monthly salary to own this phone. And if you even compare this to say an Android phone, which may have better specs and features on paper, why are people actually buying an iPhone? camera, work, UI interface, blogging, camera, data, privacy. But what if I told you people are actually not buying it for all these features, but they're actually buying it for something completely different. Actually, I have a story for you. The story begins with Agarwal Anank. And this man in that mahala was the only house which had a lawn but also had a Zen and a Maruti 800 outside his home. No one at that time actually owned a car. You know what's common with the iPhone, the car, the color TV, the CD Walkman, and all these other items. At a certain point of time, other people could not afford it. It was expensive. Second, when someone bought it, they showed it off. It was visible to everyone. And third, they all talked about why this is changing their life for the better. But all of these were actually purchased not for the features, but for social signaling. When you look at the iPhone and say it's the best, what do you really mean? The iPhone is one of the slowest charging phones. Benefit of Android phone of the year 2023, the Pixel 8. It's the backbone of what they're building off of is I would take the screen from the S22 Ultra. Different phones are good for different things and in many of them, iPhone does not rank one. iPhone is selling cool, not just features. Why do people keep still buying it? Actually, Tim Cook says this beautifully. He says, \"Our objective has never been price optimization or selling you a lowcost phone. His objective is to sell you a really great phone.\" And they try to do this with all the tech that they do, but at a low cost to themselves. And what happens is that people tie this object that other people can't have to their identity, which is why it's called the identity trap. But the identity trap gets a little worse because it starts with a gateway purchase. Let me explain how this works. Any good product is designed really well to work within an ecosystem. Other products from that mother company that fit perfectly well to make it good. For example, the GoPro, you can't just buy the normal GoPro because once you're done with normal GoPro, you want the underwater version. So, you have to buy a fitment on top of it so you can actually waterproof it. All of these guys have other products that fit seamlessly to make your life actually easy. So, this is not really a trap. It's more like a better product, but you just get sucked into it because you have to buy more from them again and again and again. And you'll notice the same beautiful design is in Apple as well. When you send a normal text message versus an iMessage, there's a difference. The AirPod, for example, perfectly syncs with your existing device and all the other devices. you can switch between them very very easily. All of these things make it nice to use an Apple product because it connects with your existing ecosystem beautifully. This is a pretty old playbook, but just Apple makes it look, you know, like I hate to say it, sexy. You might think that all these ecosystem upgrades are pulling you in and these are actually western constructs. This is not true. One of the best examples of an ecosystem lock is actually school. You go to the school and you think you have to pay the fee. But no, there are five different kinds of uniforms your parents have to pay for. Then there's the fate. There is the school excursion they had not planned. And then there are other events. They could be handprinting, drawing, other hobbies. That's an ecosystem lock because at this point once your son or your daughter is inside a school you can't say no right everything we see which is really profitable has the ecosystem lock now an ecosystem itself isn't a bad thing right I mean capitalism hair so people will lock you in and you will pay more the question is how do you get started and in Apple this thing is really really tricky you would think that right now people are buying the latest iPhone, but there is data to show that people are actually buying the iPhone 13, which is three generations away. Can you tell me why? Because it's cheaper and you can enter using a refurbished route. So, a used iPhone is what you can buy. And finally, you can signal to your friends that, \"Hey, I'm part of your club, too. I just paid a little less.\" So once you enter the refurbished route, you will actually want the latest one cuz you now crave all the features that your iPhone does not have. And you'll also see all the other items as well, like the MacBook and the iPad and everything else that they sell, which is now not available to you. You just have half a product. What happens is that you look at the new iPhone and what you see is this. A monthly EMI of 6,000 something to own the thing you've been dreaming of. Just 6,000, right? Of course not. You actually don't see all of these items that you'll actually want to buy. And this is the real cost. The iPhone is 80,000. The MacBook Air 99,900. The AirPods 4 is 12,900. The Apple Watch SE is 24,900. The iPad is 49,900 and the total cost is 2.67 lak rupees and this is the minimum cost. This is not even the high-end version of these devices. And it doesn't stop here. It continues digitally too. You must have seen this on purchase. They'll say, \"Who's going to take care of your iPhone?\" I said, \"I'll take care.\" They said, \"No, we'll also take care. Please buy Apple Care.\" And then they have all this buying the iCloud service which will keep going up because you'll keep using the iCloud. Eventually it'll run out and because of the sync you'll have to upgrade that too. And then you have Apple 1 which bundles all these subscriptions in one place. You'll need that too because well it just works so well. The point is this EMI over here is a lie because you will buy a bunch of other things and your expense is going to be more than what you thought it is. But it actually doesn't stop there. Look at this. 36% of all Apple users actually upgrade to a better device, the newer one being launched every 1 to 2 years. So what started with a single new phone of 80,000 rupees went up to a couple of lakhs. For some people, the journey didn't even start with 80,000. It started with a used phone and then they ended up spending so much. From a business lens, this is magnificent. People won't buy stuff if your product isn't good. You are not forcing them. They are doing it by choice because of societal pressure, because how cool you've made it, because of the messaging, the marketing, the tech, and the product is working. But from a personal finance lens, you're buying things because of external validation. And it's probably not the best thing for you, especially if you can't really afford it. And this brings to our final point, the illusion. The illusion started when you were a kid. Every year you wanted something that you wanted that no one else had. Remember that MRF bat? The best bat you could buy when you played cricket? That was the iPhone. Then in my life, it was the PlayStation. I and another friend had a PlayStation and each of us had different games. Whoever had the best games, our friends would congregate on that area. That was my iPhone back then. The point is every few years you've also had an iPhone equivalent your life and you achieved it, got it, but that pleasure didn't last. Even today you want another MRF bat. Except it's not the bat, it's the iPhone. Once you get the iPhone, you'll want something else. And this will never ever end. Let me simplify this for you. Take a piece of paper, divide it into two, and on the right side, write reaction. And on the left side, write things I really want. On the reaction side, you'll react to stuff that happens outside of your control, but you respond to it. Similar response theory. Basically, when a new iPhone launches, it's really cool. You feel like buying it. Put the word new iPhone there. Then a new gadget releases, put that word there as well. Next time you open an app, there is a sale on something. Put that thing over here. All these things are you reacting because they're creating an urgency though. You should buy it right now. And on the left side, you have stuff you've been wanting for a while now. Maybe it's the PlayStation. For me, it's traveling to certain countries and doing these crazy experiences. You've got to make sure that this part doesn't drain your money such that you're not able to do the stuff you really want over the long term. Is the iPhone really something that's career life defining? If it is, put it over here and then you should go and buy it. And that way, Apple won't be fooling you. You won't be fooling yourself. And you'll be buying something you actually want.",

    "transcript_full": "This watch is 25 years old and this television, this TV is 30 years old. And you see this sunduk, it's been passed down through three generation. And this right here, this camera, um, so why is it that when you buy something in 2025, the damn thing doesn't last as long? The answer is actually in these three objects. And I'm going to explain to you why don't companies build durable stuff. Think about the HMT watches. I remember my father talking about having an HMT watch that his grandfather used and how long the damn watch lasted. Not to mention how pretty it actually looked. But those watches were just durable. Another example is Tupperware. Everyone talks about it that Tupperware is good, hygienic, very good-looking, but lasts really, really long. Hence, in both these cases, there is no repeat purchases. And my guess is both of these companies went bankrupt because the products were so durable, there was no repeat purchase. So businesses understood that they had to make a product that's not just super highquality, not just super durable, but just good enough that you require replacement in the future. And it's a good first purchase. >> Let's start with the most ingenious door in any refrigerator. It has special places for bottles and it also lifts out. But that's just the doors. Think of all you can store in here on these big firm shelves. You get a shower of ice cube frosty dry. You get the best when you buy free air. >> You know that company still exists and creates this pretty normal looking fridge cuz well consumerism. Also think about furniture at your daddies or nani's home. They have beds and closets with real solid really heavy doors and they are really really proud of these sofas. It'll never go bad. But nowadays you don't get that quality. [Music] Instead, you get something called particle board. Particle board is sawdust, a bunch of pieces of wood glued together, and that's your furniture. The widespread systematic degradation of all the products around us becoming worse in quality is not by accident. It's called planned obsolescence. It's a concept where manufacturers can deliberately reduce the lifespan of the product after a few years of use. And because of this, the repeat purchase becomes more important. Remember this bulb right here? This is where planned obsolescence actually started 100red years ago. >> A birthday party for a light bulb. >> Happy birthday, dear light. Happy birthday to you. [Applause] Back then there was a cartel formed to represent the entire bulb industry. It was called the Feebas cartel, meaning bright. And what they wanted to do was make sure that bulbs don't last too long. I'm not kidding. The bulbs were lasting so long that there were no repeat purchases. And that was bad for the industry. So the cartel said anyone who builds a bulb that lasts more than 1,750 hours, they would find that bulb manufacturer a certain amount. And this was so effective that that practice became the foundation of consumerism. But there's a problem. Let's suppose your bulb or whatever you're selling doesn't last that long and wears off. There is competition. Someone will choose the same product from another manufacturer and well, you don't win. Enter marketing. Marketing is the business of creating desire, showing that you can't have it, selling it to you after a discount and then creating a new desire. So companies thought of a genius idea by outsourcing all the manufacturing and making sure they can focus on creating desire that is doing great marketing. they were able to create lots of margin which is why most product companies actually are storytelling or marketing companies. A good example to understand this are FMCG companies. >> They try to sell you something every single week. A lot of them have manufacturer completely outsourced. And if you speak to any agency out there, they will tell you the biggest spender on ads online are always FMCG companies because they have to sell you every week. Nike, same thing. H&M, same thing. None of this is wrong. It's just really, really smart. But, you know, marketing took it one step further from the manufacturing guys. Instead of waiting for the product to actually die, they started explaining why they need the new product even though the old product was all right. This is perceived obsolescence. When Apple was selling their iPods, this is the new iPod. The ads were interesting because the background was colorful, but the silhouette of the person was black and all you could see are those wired earphones going all the way down to the iPod. So, the focus was on the actual wire and that actually made it pretty cool. Every time I saw someone in the metro, I was in Singapore back then, wearing those earphones, I thought, \"Damn, that dude is cool.\" But then many years later came the AirPods, >> a new product from Apple called Apple AirPods. >> And suddenly the focus changed to just this, not the iPods itself, which means marketing and storytelling and really cool edits can shift the focus from one device to another based on just storytelling. And then we have fast fashion. You see, previously before fast fashion existed, you had simple companies selling to two major seasons, winter, summer. But fast fashion companies take this a whole different level. They actually have 52 micro seasons. That's once a week. To change the trend, manufacture desires. Have you noticed when you buy something from a fast fashion company, after fourth or fifth wash, it just fades away? A friend of mine has a t-shirt which is, I kid you not, 17 years old. Maybe more than that old. Unreal how new it looks, right? It doesn't even have like the slight fibers degrading. Not even that. So, it was like built to last. It was really expensive, but if you think about it, it's lasted way longer. Something for us to think about, right? Do you want to buy something that's one/ird the price, but doesn't last more than a few seasons? Consumerism means you buy stuff and when you buy stuff it creates a new problem and the new problems solution by capitalists is again marketing but this marketing is a little different. Every time a company strategy tells you to change your phone, exchange your headphones, the old one has to go somewhere, right? It goes to a landfill. All the poisonous stuff in it, the mercury, the lead actually seeps into the soil like this one here in Gazipur. Tech companies even use this narrative to their advantage by saying we have net zero carbon emission. We are using recycled plastic. But think about it. All the other objects inside that device is not plastic. There are other things which cannot be disposed. All that does not have a solution yet. It still goes into the soil and causes irreversible damage. And it's not just gadgets, it's also clothes. All the dyes and chemicals used seeps into the water and guess what? Gets into your food. And this will blow your socks off. A single piece of clothing, like a t-shirt, costs 2,000 L of water to actually manufacture. Think about that for a minute. All these forces put together, consumerism, ads, social bubbles, etc. the money telling you to buy stuff, desire, put it all together and you get this problem, financial loss. Now imagine a shoe, that shoe, this shoe. You purchase a shoe because you think it's 8,000 rupees. This should last about 2 years. So the cost is about 4,000 a year to wear the shoe that you'll wear every single day to the office. So it's all right, right? It's 4,000 rupees a year for 2 years. Sounds okay. But then you see the new Nike Pegasus out and you feel you got to buy that shoe and you absolutely love it and you do and once you do you wear it and people say dude that shoe looks great but you know what just happened? This shoe which was 4,000 rupees a year is now 8,000 a year because you will not wear this anymore because you're wearing that shoe now. This happens without you even knowing and you're actually spending more per year to use the same thing. Now we can blame the finance company, social media, marketing, but the actual person because of all of this is happening is not them. It's actually us. A simple way for you actually to get out of this is stop impulse purchases. As soon as you feel like buying something, just wait for one more day. you're giving yourself a night's rest. And if you still feel you need to purchase it, then maybe you should. And maybe, just maybe, if as a generation we can stop doing the impulse purchases, the manufacturers will have no choice but to hopefully improve the quality of the product that can last a little bit more and something maybe our parents can be a little bit more proud of. Planned obsolescence at the end are marketing stories. And if you choose quality plus reuse and repair your products until they give up and you don't choose impulse buying, you can actually reverse the entire cycle. [Music]",

    "transcript_full": "hey what's up man sir what should I do dude that's not how all these different Investments or asset classes actually work so let's do one thing in this episode let's talk about how do you select the right asset class for you and how do you not get so paresan gold or land we'll cover gold and land as well but before that I have a story to tell you story like And subscribe so in '90s [Music] [Music] so abishek tell me what your grandfather talks about the most investment huh uh FD fixed deposit and your dad uh property real estate okay and your mother cool and you have a younger brother as well right what is he talking about crypto and what about you what do you like uh Equity you're going to be 13 sometime right so you're [Music] Millennial that's Nifty right here what if I told you every asset class whether it's gold whether it's real estate whether it's fixed income like bonds or fixed deposits or Equity has its day in the sun all of these are cyclical right there's some cycle to all of them which we cannot predict and your grandfather's time fds were interesting let me send you some data check it out you want me to open yeah yeah open it up this yeah so let's look at say the 1940s till the 1980s if you look at that if one year FD rates had touched a high of 12% on a fixed deposit right now risk free risk I mean yeah low risk and Equity gives 12% right now with risk so FD returns go from 6% all the way to 12% why is it so high I mean the situation of India was different to inflation High um India at some point also went bankrupt uh during this time yeah so we had to give giri all of our gold and open the economy in 1991 but before that inflation was high there was political instability financially our uh companies were not doing so well back then and also India was not open to the world this is ' 9s ' 80s time before before much before' 90s and and before that is a protectionist economy we used to add import duty to it right so that because of that protectionism um inflation was high when inflation is high to reduce inflation interest rates go up are hiked by the RBI and hence FD returns are high [Music] oh% up right correct chart interest chart yeah even if he if he didn't have a chart he saw it go from 6 to 12% also there's one more aspect right a certain generation talks about an asset class more because it's easily accessible and it's talked about tring so think about it your younger brother has seen crypto on Twitter on Reddit everywhere he can see the prices he has easy access to it so what did Dad talk about property flat land on and mom talked about gold okay let me share another table with you check it out huh it's a table okay yeah yeah perfect perfect this is the price of 10 g of gold 1975 197 180 rupe and it's gone from 500 then it's gone to 1, 1980 keep going down up to 60,000 now after ' 80s and ' 90s is where our parents were growing and looking at these prices and they're saying it's gone to 3,000 going to 4,000 5,000 there's a dip also this got a 5,000 14,000 26,000 31,000 and today it's at 58,000 60k almost 60k now the point is and I'm not saying gold will continue to go up the point is your father has heard from his father that gold has gone from 500 all the way to 50,000 60,000 of course they will think gold is amazing and they're seeing this over decades right she's not wrong correct difference between and gold but yes correct don't think dollars right so these are Indian prices in America gold prices from the ' 80s to now have been largely sideways you've not seen a growth like this this is like uh Indian culture right Conant like not constant but it's been roughly the same in India the culture of saving is there and the culture of having gold is there we have a we go and buy gold it's part of our culture so there is inherent demand because we are Indians but my point is gold has also had its day in the sun that's why your friend said but it may not happen every year you're getting what I'm saying right its accessibility its Cycles every asset has its day in the Sun and at that point of time your friend did but 2009 nothing would have beaten Nifty but we'll come to that later and we'll talk about risk later I want to talk about real estate in real estate I've already sent you the data when I sent you this open it up wa second and see um like this data like I said right like your parents your father also would have seen real estate go up as he was growing urbanization people were moving from villages to cities complexes industrialization was happening infosis all these things happened where employment was generated so housing prices and development happened correct and not wrong right so if you look at if you look at this this is a this is the attempt to find residential prices K prices look at that look at Bangalore Bangalore the pink the pink one compared to say Mumbai which is the orange now the problem is when I say real estate what am I talking about here's the problem with real estate the real estate has a dual purpose people think of it as um an investment people think of it as rent seeking I can get uh rental yield from it and people also can live inside it so it's very unlike any other asset class that's why there's an emotional reason attached to [Music] it right so now when you're saying now the nuances are what location which house what type of residential is it residential is it commercial you have these nuances over here so it's very difficult to say um which Real Estate will go up or down and function function most people don't buy I mean shouldn't buy real estate just for investment right you may look at it as a place to actually live your children may grow there you'll spend your time there's an emotional connection to it that rental yield is another thing people say it's about 3 to 4% so if you have a house worth 1 CR people expect a 3 lakh rupe rental Yi to come from it a year so now the question is someone sitting over here in 2012 or 15 looking back the last 10 years what will the guy in Chennai think about real estate versus the g line so the same thing is over here every asset has its day in the sun with real estate geography location all of these other things coming real estate yeah I don't think so it's pretty nuanced I imagine you meet an uncle who's seen the real estate market in jaur versus you see an uncle who's seen uh the real estate market in Mumbai though the person from Mumbai will say real estate is good jaur will say I think it's risky I will also think the person in jaur will say ke XYZ people I know have made a lot of money from Real Estate so even this may not give the correct picture of real estate because the location really matters H it's not like you should not invest in real estate every asset class has its day in the sun your job is to diversify and understand the risk for each you can't take very high risk on your entire portfolio Okay so now let's move on to the next story which is you what ass class Equity so open up Nifty I'm sure you already have the chart yes [Music] yes notice is Nifty is pretty flat and then after 1991 the market goes up a lot so 90s kid so you've heard1 interesting scam and you saw stock markets go up you also saw stock markets go down 2008 and then Market went up again so you've seen two cycles two really large Cycles oh 91a oh co also correct Co also so you've seen these Cycles that's why you believe in Nifty a little more you also see Nifty on Twitter on YouTube people talk about Index Fund but you still get upset with 6% return because patience so people our age generally tend to like equities a little more but if you were in America you would probably think the same thing but what if you were in Japan open open Nik and it's Nik 225 it's a list of 225 top stocks in Japan and they made an index out of it this one this one look at that very different from and go back to Nifty look at Nifty ah go back to Nik Everest just just never tracked up so people in Japan are likely to not think Equity is great huh because they have this history geography matters on what the asset class is could this be India way into the future Equity it could it could may not happen soon but it could happen in the future the first takeaway from this episode is that every investment or asset class has its day in the sun diversify correct okay and the second thing is you should know the risk for each asset class RIS return the potentially return can be higher which means okay Equity versus land land risk equity which is why Equity gives better risk adjusted returns so returns in equity are better than real estate at least what the data we have is better and re and Equity comes on top but because you're taking RIS High return high risk High return that's why you cannot invest in equity for one year you have to think 5 10 years because higher risk it's the nature of the asset class and speaking of risk uh if you have really high risk to earn high return you can also suu in your pants like crypto so this is Bitcoin looks good right it's pretty good actually and uh Spike what about open Doge what's that Elon Musk is Doge right do open Dogecoin Dogecoin that's Dogecoin what is this this is the price of Doge kind do you think crypto is high risk or low risk high risk super high don't know it's a 12-year-old asset class and we still don't know what's going to happen but super high risk super high reward be yes correct so this is super high reward uh and why didn't you open Luna Luna so this is Luna's chart what do you notice huh correct the price went from that high over there all the way to zero it's it's zero you lost everything look at that Luna USD 0. 62 it's gone so now tell me if you have 1 lakh rupes how will you invest it okay emotional damage okay serious question I think you have to answer personally are you going to equally do it or are you going to give a little more weightage to maybe some some asset class that's your personal choice as long as you understand but if you look at the math these are all of the asset classes and their historical returns equities on top with the best returns I've excluded crypto because I don't think we have a lot of information yet and look at everything else so the answer is diversify understand the risk alloc and let time do the talking the time is what will give you correct if you thought this episode was good hit that like hit that subscribe say great job abishek in the comments ments and and and and teacher okay uh and hit that like and hit that subscribe and tell us next episode May what do you want us to cover we're also talking in Hindi and English now so hope that is good because everyone in the chat was saying in the comments were saying Hindi Hindi but uh we also have subtitles so let me know if this worked and uh see you in the next episode right abish bye bye huh can you give me a treat now I",

raise Venture Capital their business will do well and to be honest no one really talks about how the VC ecosystem works what are their incentives and motives and no one really talks about what are the entrepreneurs motives what should he be focusing on so this results in a muddled understanding of this entire thing of running your own startup so we thought let's de influence your expectations about building your own company and raising money we'll talk about the good and the bad cuz no one else will let's begin [Music] so there's nothing wrong with actually raising money from a VC and there's nothing wrong in VCS existing because a lot of the products and the Innovations we see around us and the products we use every single day happened because of risk Capital risk Capital by Venture capitalists and private Equity so a lot of traditional businesses can't make 200 300% growth in a single year consistently but certain Tech startups can but since Banks won't give money to these Tech startups because the markets new the business new everything's new the risk is just too high they need risk capital and this is where VC funds come and they're two kinds of businesses VCS will usually invest in one an Emerging Market a fast growing Market that requires a lot of capital to capture the share of that market like right now it's the AI arms race the second kind of business business is a company that's growing exponentially really fast is usually in the realm of tech because as Revenue grows cost does not grow for Tech and usually these kinds of companies require VC money for example the entire AI Market out there is powered by computation and the computation happens from graphics cards the graphic card is made by Nvidia so Nvidia requires a lot of money now the interesting thing is NVIDIA doesn't even manufacture these chips all they do is design the chips but the cost of Designing a chip is really expensive because it needs to design prototype test and this costs a lot of money and it requires VC funding and for companies like Amazon and Zat and swiggy all these companies are building something that didn't exist before so when you have a new market and you're trying to capture that market all you have to focus on is R&D new things Staffing Etc and this costs money it is risky and therefore you need risk Capital therefore you need investors I've met so many entrepreneurs worth thousands of crores they're not raising money to increase their own net worths and the VCS aren't giving them money for fun it is done as a business decision and there's a reason behind it but before we talk about the reason of why money should be raised and whether a business is investable or not let's talk about how a venture capital fund actually works once you understand that you'll be able to understand what an investable business is so let's see how a VC fund operates I'm going to oversimplify this a little bit so the first player we have over here is the investor it could be a large pension fund it could be an insurance fund it could be other kinds of people could even be an ultra high net worth individual but these people would invest tens maybe even hundreds of million dollars in a single fund all of that is invested in let's say this the VC fund the VC fund is owned by a group of managers which means these guys actually pitch to different LPS or different investors to raise money for themselves and each VC fund will have their own thesis some would say Tech is great some would say we invest in consumer durables some would say we invest in fmcg some would say different things they have their own way of looking at the world and if these guys agree then they get the money and they get a commitment then we have People Like Us the people trying to raise money and there are lots and lots of entrepreneurs trying to actually do this now it's very simple to see that money was raised here they have a fund they will distribute and start investing equity in each of these companies and try to raise some money let's suppose this fund has raised a $100 million just to run the fund this guy will charge something called a management fees which is 1 to 2% a year so they'll take $1 to $2 million a year just to keep the lights on on top of that if the fund makes a profit then this team makes a 20% cut of that profit now there are a bunch of other rules over here like high Watermark Etc which I won't get into but basically this guy's job is really tough because after all fees he still has to give a 15 or 20% return to these guys at the end of say 10 years and that's 15 20% a year imagine that compounded over the next 10 years it's really really tough and why it's tough is because lots of startups actually fail this study talks about 90% of startups never being able to give any return to their investors this means that this is a highly risky investment and it's important that one of these guys give a huge return how will they give a return by giving huge growths how will they grow by being super aggressive take a look at this graph this is the the return multiple of the top 100 startups of a VC firm called y combinator if you look at Airbnb you'll see it's given 6,000 X return and that's really cool and even the top five startups gave a huge return too what you don't see here is the thousands of companies y combinator invested in these companies are the ones which gave a return the others probably didn't this is called the power law you'll also see that the returns are so skewed that in 2009 you have great returns while all other years are average or below average so the power law Works in terms of time as well which means these companies need to give much more than 10x at least some of them but he doesn't know which so he will push all of them to get to 10x 50x 100x this means unreasonable growth even if there is no demand and this comes to the first problem what if the industry doesn't need it what if the industry is not do what if is no demand then these people will be forced to grow even though that there is no scope for it to happen now I'm not saying all VCS do this but a lot of VCS do see the world like this because they're forced in this kind of situation and the second problem is that because it's a 10e cycle they have to return the money to the LPS which means that they can sometimes Force an exit or they have to find a buyer to give it to someone else so that they can return the money to someone else this causes a problem with the founders sometimes but before you you are invested in a VC all parties know this it's not like this is a surprise the investor knows it that they're expecting a huge growth curve and the person asking for the money knows it they've both agreed and they both think that the growth will happen that's why the investment happens now let's talk about the other side the founders side so when you look at Founders and we see that they've raised a lot of money very easily the truth couldn't be further it's really tough to raise money I had a friend who was starting a business business in a new industry completely and he literally met 110 investors which was 110 meetings those are 110 pitches then there are 110 follow-ups and there were almost 105 rejections and four of them didn't reply and one said okay this means it's really tough to raise money there are two things you need to know about raising money one how good is your skill if you're really good at something something no one else has in the country and you're using that skill inside a business it really helps not only that that business needs to be scalable and growing fast second it all comes down to relationships if you know these people well it becomes a little easy now I know a lot of you are thinking I'll just go and meet people and become friends with them does not work like that your work speaks for you usually these kinds of people want to meet you if you've done a really good job building something so instead of going out to network think about the opposite you have to do so well that they want to meet you and then we have the fact that most startups are not investable now what does that mean think very carefully when we looked at that example over here a company needs to have the potential to grow 100x or 200x heck it should have the potential to do 1,000x if it's possible so now if you think about it let's imagine a clothing company can a clothing company do, X yes it can but it has some problems one problem is every time it tries to grow it has to spend more and buy from the wholesale Department spend on ads to acquire the user distribute it across the country and there is cost for every time it delivers something correct so that means as Revenue goes up cost will also go up now when they say scalable they mean that the business grows but the cost roughly Remains the Same or grows very very slowly and that Gap is what creates a huge value for the VC Point number two a higher Equity ownership does not mean more control now you tell me if someone owns 55% of the business and you own 45 who makes all the decisions everyone will think the guy with 55% makes all the decisions this is not true the truth is all the decisions are usually made by a a board and the board has certain powers now it depends on how these powers are distributed let me explain even if you own 90% of the company you are giving away certain rights the point to know here is this that the powers reside in what is documented and not the equity ownership another example is that Mark Zuckerberg owns less than 50% of Facebook but in America there are class B shares and a shares and different classifications and based on that he has voting control of the board so even though there's a lower percentage of ownership he still controls most of the decision of the board and therefore a lot can pass another thing we should talk about is Founders making money from startups now think about it we all think if we own a large stake we'll make more money there are few problems over here one you may not be able to sell those shares if your company doesn't do well no one buys it that was just paper wealth the second aspect is that even if you're not a Founder you can still own shares via esops as an employee and an esops can make a lot of wealth if things align properly like Cheryl Sandberg she joined Facebook way later and she's an employee and over the last 10 years she sold $1.6 billion worth of shares Point number three fundraising is a never ending process and let me explain this why from a VC's perspective so when a VC invests in a startup he wants to grow that money by getting the second round of funding and helping the company do the third round of the funding and helping the company do the fourth round and the fifth round and the sixth round you get what I'm saying he wants more rounds of funding so that the valuation increases now why would a company keep raising money because it needs the money to grow what is growth growth could be any metric it could be signups could be Revenue could be traffic could be new rides taken every single day in the case of uber could be transactions per second for a financial platform etc etc but the founder can pick the metric then he needs to pump in money to push that metric up 10 million 50 million 100 million 200 million the J curve keeps rising and because of this rise you're able to raise new money and maybe in a series B or C the initial investors can exit so fundraising becomes a requirement and it becomes a NeverEnding process imagine if you told your investor I will raise one round and stop how will the investor then make money that's a problem right and this may not be good for the founder or the startup because sometimes you just don't need to grow at any cost for no reason right in some cases it's needed but in many cases it's not I don't know it's different for each company but definitely doesn't sound good to me Point number four high amount of money raised does not equal to success I know right now you're thinking but if you look at the example of quby it raised $1.7 billion and in one year of operation shut down and failed you have to remember for a company to work it's not just Capital it's the team it's the right time it's the product it's how you keep the team together it's the culture it's also whether you're competing properly or not it's your strategy it's so many things put together and only once these planets align does success happen which is why it's so difficult to run a startup Point number five raising money doesn't make Founders rich and a high valuation doesn't really mean the founders may be making money you don't know it actually let me read this this story is about Ariana Huffington who sold a company for $315 million that's a lot right htin post is pretty popular people use it and she sold for $315 million but she walked away with only $21 million think about that for a moment this basically means that the value of your company is nothing to do with how much the founder makes it has a lot to do with other things also has a lot to do with liquidation preference which we covered in this de influencing video you should definitely watch",

    "transcript_full": "I travel to Paris London Amsterdam even visited Africa all for free and I'll tell you how you can do it for free too the first step is very simple you're got to find this guy he's going to take all your photographs put it inside a computer use Photoshop change the backgrounds to make it look good make sure you match the lighting and the shadow and these small knickknacks fix it voila looks good add a good caption make it a carousal tell a story because if the story isn't good it won't distract them from the actual photo keep going and then you have a Fantastical following of jealous of fans who love your life right and then you can sell them stuff right Paris Italy on a freaking green screen in a studio you must be kidding me actually it's really easy on the internet to fake anything a six-pack AB body a beautiful lifestyle and all that travel and easy money leaving feeling you thinking that you too can become an influencer and earn all that money easily in this episode we're going to De influence the luxurious and easy life of influencers we'll talk about the good and the bad cuz clearly the internet is lying to you so let's begin in the '90s we had only two kinds of Heroes well maybe four our parents actors doctors and lawyers because they had great jobs even engineers and of course we had Sportsmen if we looked at these Sports people we thought wow what if I could be this that means only a small number of people could be Legends then came the internet and Instagram Facebook and whatnot and covid and suddenly everyone could become a hero simply with one light and a camera you could have 10 minutes of worldwide Fame now your next own neighbor could be a little more famous than you but barely doing anything maybe this dance video or a stupid prank and he gets so many views and then we see stuff like this all these YouTubers making cors of rupees and these guys abroad making millions and then we have them going on private jets traveling buying cars living the freaking high life but that is supposed to be you right why aren't you getting all of this have you ever felt that this means content creators create a new kind of feeling that has been unexplored by the masses and this feeling is insecurity but like every the influencing episode we're going to talk about the realities and I think in my experience I was once in Bangalore 01 has a lot of fans and some of them are youngish but very rarely we meet people really young like this 12-year-old who stopped me while I was trying to get into a cab held my hand was telling me how much he loves Z1 and all the other channels he follows and then he looks up to me and says I want to become a YouTuber when I grew up I asked him why he said because YouTubers make lacks of rupees every day and probably 10 to 20 CR rupees a year I have no idea how he got such a specific number but his Source was The Good Old Reliable internet obviously this is not true but let's talk about the reality I want to read a few head lines for you the first one Chinese social media influencer dies trying to lose more than 100 kgs at a weight loss boot camp 21-year-old dies as Instagram real attempt goes wrong in up Village influencer Remy B shared her struggles with binge eating but says followers responded with cruel body shaming comments so what's the reality of all these content creators are all of them bad of course not I would say none of them are bad reality is always neutral but the parties playing this game get caught in this insecurity web in fact this person over here conducted a research about happiness and social media and basically out of all of his research he came to say a social media content creator is a performer where both parties the consumer and the Creator feel awful afterwards the viewer feels that he doesn't have something in life and feels bad the Creator knows that it's impostor syndrome hitting him and all of this is not true but he needs to do it for engagement so what's the deal is the life of a content creator actually amazing and what you see on the internet is it even real influencers influencer the influencer today influencing has become a real job it is a 250 billion dollar economy seven out of 10 indiia they believe what these social media influencers are saying indent Regulators are hunting down Financial influencers my point is you cannot be sure about their motives so let's talk about the influencer lifestyle the first thing you need to know is that nothing on the Internet is actually real not this perfect pen and my perfect throw you see and my perfect throw you see do you see nothing on the Internet is real so my point is very simple the next time you see an online influencer showing you this crazy life where he's jet setting making a lot of money it's not true I once saw this amazing real of a person talking about how much money he made and I thought he' say one or two or $3 million but he said a number in billions it was this video the most amount of money that you ever made in a single year in 20 19 I sold 76 companies for 1.27 billion and my friend asked me and shared it and said dude how is this guy making so much money from private Equity all you needed to do was click on that profile and see in the description that he's actually selling a course on how to make billions of dollars why would a billionaire sell a course it's not true it's not true it's just not true and even these photos of a private jet you guessed it are fake we found a studio in Gau where you pay a couple of thousand rupees and you can actually use this set to show that it's a private but then I found this story which I thought was very interesting it says Tik Tok star who bragged of jet setting lifestyle jailed in Peru for drug smuggling another epidemic is unrealistic beauty standards and let me tell you a little story King Lou the 14th I think used to dress up like this his wig looks magnificent his much look well thin his arms and body looks fine until you see this his stockings and his heels this was the epitome of power dressing and manliness beauty standards change every era like in my time we used to wear tight jeans but now you cannot because it doesn't look well it looks Millennial but if beauty standards are changing every few decades that means all these standards are say it with meal false a lot of these other things that we call values don't change but beauty standards do I know it's not a value but why are you so obsessed about it why is the internet so obsessed about it because content creators do this it's called trickery sorry it's called Photoshop but I want to go one step further and show you how camera angles and lighting can completely change what you actually see or what the camera actually [Music] sees you can look good sty but you can't do this let me show you what I mean by this and these are true stories people are getting plastic surgery to look like Snapchat filters what social media usage correlated with desire for cosmetic procedures in a new study there's a study which says that cosmetic procedures are increasing because of the insecurity that's created on the internet that's not a good reason to do cosmetic surgery right what do you think now let's talk about the best part of this video the Moola the money the sponsorships Pisa a sponsorship is basically when a company comes to a person who has distribution also known as content creator to talk about their product and basically sell more of their M and this is completely normal it's been happening for so long pellet used to be radio TV Holdings Etc and now it's YouTubers and content creators nothing wrong with that in fact if you have liked this video so far then you should definitely check out jakas pooker Baba sheep.com because over here you can play multiple games and you will win real cash go to the link in the description click on the link and then type mama and you will get 10 Rupees off on your first transaction you get my point when such a thing happens that actually harms the user because it's financially bad for them or mentally bad for them then that becomes a problem and I'm not making any of this up we actually have data from the advertising Council of India where they say 39% of ads checked were in some kind of violation 17% of ads belonged to Illegal betting apps 21% of ads were not even disclosed by the influencers which means that there's an ad you just don't know it they actually not using the product and if you look at the top 10 violation categories it's Healthcare betting apps and personal care which means that if something wrong is being pedal because there is a violation according to the standards here you're either losing your health or your money now I'm not saying sponsorship is bad if it's done the right way it's completely fine it's good for everyone involved and that's how the economy actually grows but sometimes people get greedy actually influencers get greedy and up like a few weeks ago this new app which promised 100% rewards if you invested in it would come up it was a mystery box where you would invest in some amount of money and guaranteed you would get something back sometimes it was an iPhone they even promised a car I think so this person invested 11 lakh rupees in the app God knows it's not an investment when you do something like this but okay he used the word investment and the app was removed from the Play Store I'm guessing because it is illegal and just not right that's why and then of course we have fame fame is the byproduct of creating content and getting a lot of Engagement if your content is relatable people share it the algorithm pushes it you get more users following increases you get a good feedback loop and if you do it long enough you get a nice following another byproduct of that quick rise is bullying like these news reports here the frenzy of unrelenting online bullying further destroys the mental health of those already suffering and everyone has a role to play so online bullying is a real thing it's not funny and it is extremely serious exactly like real life bullying and I think the owners of Facebook and YouTube and all should agree that they are selling New Age drugs to new people where people are so addicted that while they're driving or they're talking or they're meeting someone in a restaurant offline they're addicted Ed to this their screen there's a reason why Black Mirror on Netflix has done so well because it's scarily eie and it could possibly happen in real life too but the problem of fake followers also exists I mean what's interesting is that sometimes they have a lot of followers and the engagement is really low I mean look at this headline where they say grace Africa which is a name of an influencer meet and greet video Tik Tok star with 1.3 million followers that's 13 lakh follow followers organizes a Meetup and no one shows up at that event how is that even possible so what are the things you can do immediately to understand how this influencer thing is messing with your mind one know that there are two kinds of influencers the first kind is a person who hacked the algorithm and just has a lot of followers but is not actually famous they just have a lot of followers there's a difference the second kind is the person who has worked on his craft for years and years and has industry respect like Casey or Ronaldo or Shah ruk Khan or anyone else who's really done what they really enjoy and because they're so good at their craft they have a following these people should have a little more respect at least for you I do because they've built something of their own and out of respect people hit that follow button not because the algorithm forced them to two everyone has low moments everyone has high moments you should change your expectations from all these physical things you see on Instagram to something that's an inner barometer like here in our company these are our Milestones the celebrations we do the outings we have but we also have low moments last year was not so great for us and that is part of life this year is so we're celebrating it find your lows and highs because over a long period of time it'll all seem like a nice smooth uptrend well hopefully and see you in the next episode or pass or not even my perfect pen throw jakas poker Baa Baa baaba Black Sheep use my use my [Music]",

    "title_current": "How I Lost Lakhs Buying My Luxury Dream Car!",
    "transcript_full": "[Music] This 65 lakh rupee luxury car is now available for just 18 lak rupees in the used car market. And you think >> this is a Germanmade high quality car, right? I mean look at those features. So if you account for the downpipe, the EMI, the interest, and all these costs, does that 18 lakh look a lot bigger in actual cost? So I did the math to figure out if you should buy a new car for 18 lakh rupees or a used luxury car for the same price. So let's analyze these two cars using these four parameters. Starting with the EMI, the Audi is a 6-year-old luxury used car and the Creta is a brand new car. Now both of these cars cost 18 lakh rupees. We assume the loan to value to be 80% for both cars. This is basically how big a loan value you get for the X showroom cost. But in reality, you'll actually have to pay a lot more because the LTV will be lower for a luxury used car. But just to keep the calculations fair, let's assume it's 80%. The down payment is 3.6 lakhs, which brings our loan amount to 14.4 lakh rupees. Now, there's one thing that changes a lot, and that's the interest rate. Now, depending what bank you take it from, you will pay more in interest rate when you buy a used luxury car, and this could be 4 to 5% more than the actual Creta. So let's say the used car is 14.5% interest and the new car's interest is 9.5%. Now let's talk about the tenure of the loan. We've kept it at 5 years for both cars, but used car loans typically capped at 3 to 5 years versus up to 7 years for a new car loan. Now the used Audi A4 EMI is about 34,000 rupees and the new Hyundai Creta SX tech is 30,000. So that makes the total repayment cost 20.3 lakhs for the Audi and 18.14 lakhs for the Creta. So here you're paying 2.18 lakh rupees more simply because the interest rate is higher. Now before we move on to the next parameter, I want you to do two things. One, write your luxury car option and your new car option. Submit it in the comments. And second, complete the entire exercise on Excel and then reply to your own comment on what changed. Let's see if you changed your mind or if it was the same. This brings us to parameter number two, which is the running cost of the car. And I love this one because no one thinks about it. Now, you've bought a luxury car. I mean, you're going to drive it around. You're going to go for trips. You're going to go with parents and family, and you're just going to enjoy the damn car. That's why you bought it, right? But there's one thing you probably don't know, which is mileage. Needless to say, as the machine becomes older, the mileage, the efficiency actually decreases. Some reports say after 2% every single year. So a 6-year-old Audi which was giving say 16 kmp may now give you 14. These are obviously not real numbers because I do not drive a used Audi. On the other hand, a new car and in this case the Hyundai Creta seems to be giving a lot more mileage 17 to 18 km a liter. So obviously fuel efficiency wise the Creta is going to be cheaper when it comes to running costs of the car. Now let's say you travel 50 km every day for 300 days. The total distance traveled in a year is about 15,000 km. So now let's assume the cost of petrol is 100 rupees a liter. And to make this trip, you'll need about 1,000 L for the Audi and about 880 L for the Creta. That means you'll be spending about 19,000 rupees extra every year because you're driving the Audi. Now to be fair, I don't think that's a lot, but we'll still keep it on the Excel sheet. Now let's talk about the boring bit, the maintenance cost. So when you're driving, it's actually going to start costing a little more because the wear and tear happens. Now, how do you actually calculate wear and tear? We'll calculate. So let's assume you drive the car 15,000 km a year. Now you have a 6-year-old car and we have to assume that it's traveled a little bit. And our script writer assumed that 42,000 is a good number. So let's stick to that. And let's also assume that both cars get serviced only twice a year. The Audi will obviously cost a little more. And one service for an Audi is 22,000 rupees and that amounts to 44,000. And the new car's service will be absolutely free because in most cases any new car you buy will have the first few services free. So over here you'll see that we've included things like engine oil, oil filter, air filter, coolant, 10,000 for the Audi and 5,000 for the Creta. Another problem is the cost of repairs and the parts for a luxury car. They cost way more. So over here we've added 70,000 for a front bumper and replacing a headlight could cost up to 43,000. So I've assumed an average of 50,000 a year for stuff that needs to be replaced. But the spare parts for the new car will comparatively be cheaper. One headlight replacement costing 20,000 and a door repair amounting to save 14,000. So I've assumed an average of 20,000 of these expenses every year. You'll notice I've overestimated this a little bit, but you can obviously tone it down, change it in the Excel sheet. So, now let's add up the total annual cost. It's 25,000 for the new car and 1 lakh for the used luxury car. It's a 4x difference. Most people actually completely miss this, but if you knew it, then uh give yourself a pat on the back. The third parameter is insurance. Over here you see the insurance declared value is the value that the insurer tells you how much your car is worth and everything is calculated on the base of that. For a new car it's about 95% of the X showroom price. The new car's IDV is 17.10 lakhs and the Audi A4's IDV is the same as how much you bought it for because the depreciation is included. That's 18 lak rupees. Now based on this value the insurance premium will be decided. Now, we've taken both of the cars and assumed a comprehensive insurance. And this is what it looks like. The 3-year comprehensive cover for Creta includes own damage premium, third party premium, personal accident cover, add-ons, and an 18% GST. The insurance amounts to 79,000 for 3 years. That's about 26,300 per year. And for the Audi, it amounts to 23,600 rupees a year. Now, since this is a used car, you'll be renewing your insurance every single year. and the cost will also keep coming down because the car is aging. But because of that, the repairs and maintenance will go up and that will be out of pocket. Of course, if you're able to find a zero depth insurer and you get that insurance, then you can take care of that. But this is something that if you're buying a secondhand car, you have to make sure of. Now, here's a final parameter, parameter four. Putting this all together and figuring out how much is this actually costing for each of these two cars. Now let's project this ownership over the next 5 years because that's when the real cost of ownership happens, right? So let's start with the Audi. The cost is going to be 20.32 lakhs if you take a loan to buy the car. Then is the fuel of the car and I've also assumed a 6% increase in the cost of fuel because these prices keep going up. So the total cost after 5 years is 6 lak rupees. Then we have insurance. We'll assume a 10% depreciation on the car every year. So the cost here is 96,100 rupees for insurance alone. Next we've assume maintenance cost and this is about 6.34 lak rupees over the next 5 years. This is obviously the highest cost that you can see because luxury car expensive. So total cost of ownership is nearly 33.68 lak rupees for the Audi. Now let's see the new car. The same thing. The cost is 18.14 lakhs if you take a loan. The fuel cost is 4.97 lakhs. The insurance is 26,000 a year. So that's about 97,000 rupees for 5 years. The maintenance cost is only 1.8 lakh rupees because um a new car is easier to maintain obviously. Now if you remember the new car, we assume there is no service cost in the first year but after that the costs actually begin. We've included 10,000 rupees every year for the next 4 years. So the total cost of ownership is 25.90 lakhs. So the difference between the two is hold up now you are either one of two users who's watched this entire damn video. Either you're really hardcore researching and figuring it out or you can't afford the car. So maybe you shouldn't buy it right now. Leave it something somewhere in the future and then you can decide because the difference between these two on the Excel sheet is 7.78 lak rupees.",

    "transcript_full": "Sir, sir, I need your help. I have a problem. And you remember I proposed to Danya. [music] >> Yeah. Why? Why? >> She has asked for two things before getting married. >> She agreed. >> Yes. [music] >> Number one is financial report. Number two is health report. Now thanks to you financials to sorted but health is not that. >> But you look healthy. You look >> I am not. Okay. I spoke to he gave me this excel. I have to spend a minimum of 25,000 on my health. >> So, can you just raise my salary? >> No. No, not at all. Account. We'll spend 5 minutes. I'll fix your uh troubles of this 25,000. I'll reduce the budget in case if you lose, I'll get 30,000 increment. 25,000 plus 5,000 penalty. [music] What? Huh? Whatever. Huh? You'll lose whatever. Show me the Excel sheet. So, by the way, how did you reach this 25,000 figure? >> It's in the Excel. Now, wait. You see this? daily diet and groceries, gym, trainer, protein powder, creatine, preworkout, travel cost, and I'm sure some subscription and tracker as well. You see this number? It says 25,000. >> Before we actually bring down the cost, let's define what does healthy mean. >> Six pack abs studio and then expensive that that band health fitness band. And then I need to get those special shoes, you know. >> Um, I don't think you and I can decide what health means. That's your Instagram definition of it. Maybe maybe we should talk to an expert. >> People have really complicated the idea of a healthy lifestyle these days. I think a healthy lifestyle simply means that your energy, your sleep, your digestion, your mood cannot be fighting against you. Bare minimum is just three things. You must sleep 7 to 8 hours every day. Try and get some form of movement every day. And if at all that's not happening, then walk at least 5 to 10k steps every day. And every meal must have fiber and protein. Healthy living is honestly a simple formula. 20% is activity or movement or exercise and 80% is having a healthy diet. >> Are sir but I'm having home-cooked meals. I I think it's healthy enough. >> No, no. Actually, this is a misconception. Even I know this a little bit that dal actually has more carbs than protein. It's not in the right ratio. We don't intake enough protein. Even the ICMR says 0.8 g per kilogram. And my trainer isn't happy with that. Also, he says 1.5 to 2x of my body weight I need to consume. And I try that's 100 g to 140 g daily. So >> agreed, sir. This is the only protein I can afford right now. >> Disgusting. Which brings me >> to the first solution. Anti- gas syndrome. >> What syndrome? I'm not making this up. It's there's actually scientific logic behind this. It's called gear acquisition syndrome. Look [music] at this. Basically, it's the compulsive urge to purchase new equipment and other things by by musicians because they think when they purchase these things, their musical ability or their creativity will actually improve. >> It's about my health. I'm not a musician. >> Correct. So the same thing actually exists for fitness freaks as well who have not really become uh fitness freaks yet. So they will get expensive bands like you said they'll buy shoes, they'll buy all this equipment and actually not just do even 15 minutes of working out. So this actually creates a dopamine inside your brain. You actually buy all of these things in anticipation of going to the gym eventually and you [music] waste a lot of money. >> So what should I do? Basically, don't focus on buying all this gear. Just go to the freaking gym. If you're unsure about this, your job is to find something you enjoy. So, what do you like to do? >> A gyming. >> Okay. So, you want to go to the gym. >> You enjoy it. >> Yes. >> The biggest risk in a gym is that they will ask you to pay for one year upfront because it's cheaper and because of this at some point you will quit the gym. >> I I don't want to quit now. I want to join. >> Correct. But ask your friends, ask the people around you. How [music] many people paid for a year? Look at Bandit and that entire group in the office. They paid for a year, went for one or two months and then [music] quit or they put their membership on pause. This is not just a local thing. This happens across the country, across the world, which is why they give you a discount on the yearly membership. This deote paper actually proves it. If this is the biggest risk, find an average gym right now. Take a short-term plan. which is not that expensive >> which is not expensive and get into the habit of going to the gym every day or you can just do home workout for 3 months. >> So now let's reduce the gym cost uh the trainer cost subscription and travel. [music] >> Once you're doing it very regularly then you can invest in a good gym and maybe even pay for 12 months. >> I did I think I didn't save enough if I >> There are also a bunch of other hacks right here. If some of them are useful you can try them out >> sir. I think you have lunch. >> What is this? Give me just 5 minutes. Problem here. All of us order all this food from outside which is bad for our health and it's expensive and we want to be healthy. It makes no sense. So the ICMR has taken out a nourished diet. [music] something to nourish a human body and we looked at that and found out it's roughly 150 rupees to 200 rupees per day. So we use that as a template and that's about 5 to 6,000 rupees a month. Let's make it 7,000 rupees. Add one more,000 rupees. But actually this 7,000 rupees a month car diet can change a lot depending whether [music] you're staying at home or outside whether you cook yourself or there's a tiffen that you get whether you're ordering from certain places your food preferences you could be vegan you could be hardcore non-vegetarian you could be vegetarian and because of this the variability on the food comes a lot but the point is this whether you're spending 7,000 or 10,000 you need to make sure that healthy food is going in. So the thing is that a healthy diet might not always take care of your micronutrients. That is where supplements come in place and quietly save your life. The best way is to get a blood work done. The blood work will tell you exactly what all deficiencies you have and then go to a physician. And this is important because the physician will tell you how and when to take it. Let's say I'm calcium deficient and I don't have to take it every day. He will tell me that take this for a month but take it alternate days. Vegans majorly need omega3 and B12 because their diet cannot take care of that. So understand your body's deficiencies and build your diet accordingly. And if you want to know how much it actually costs, um take your diet, map it actually see how you can make it healthier, I'm not saying cheaper, healthier and see what that budget comes to. In this [music] case I have changed it to 7,000 rupees for him. sir but I don't order food that much. >> You don't order from outside. >> I just ordered a lunch. Yes. >> Really? >> Yeah. >> 100%. >> Well, it's a number. >> What is this? This is a Chrome extension. You'll find a lot of them online where you can actually calculate all of your year's expense on all these apps as one number. Kai, read it. >> Read it. Oh, it's food. 90,000. >> That's almost 8,000 rupees per month. Per month, >> I think. >> So, you've been lying to me. >> No, no. Something is wrong with the number. I'm not ordering that much. >> UI is so slick and beautiful. And Bhook is always so high that you don't realize how much you spent. >> This is something is wrong. >> So, this is how much you actually spend. Now, see, you can't make this 8,000 rupees and make it zero. You will order online. It's natural. But you should reduce this. Let's try to reduce it to 4,000. And that's how much we've saved. Cool. >> I can still order food from outside. >> You can, but just bring it down a little bit. By the way, can you uh take this extension, go around the office and ask expense so we can compare how much is this office actually spending on this? >> Hello. for the entire year around. >> So basically we have saved 4,000. >> Yes, you've saved 4,000. >> Now I'll invest this in SIP bonds. Bonds and compound the number will go up and that's how my number will go down. [music] No, >> not at all. If you have to choose between health and sip or any form of investments, you always choose health. >> Health >> of health. >> No, you always choose health. >> So you were spending 8,000 rupees a month. >> We'll reduce this 8,000 to 4,000. >> So what will I do with it? I can increase my healthy diet. >> Yeah. So you will reallocate that saved money into a healthier plan, healthier diet. Because if you're eating healthy, you will order from outside hopefully a little less. Fair. No. And apart from this, we know we all have some vices. Some people have alcohol. It might be smoking or eating junk food. When your stress or cravings hit, try to reduce this too. I really want you to think about this very carefully. If you get ill less in the future, a world of possibility opens up. You're healthier. You can think clearer. You can earn more. You can improve your skills. You can do all this investing stuff. You can watch more 01 videos. You can be a little bit like Abishek. >> Everything is not an immediate ROI. Just like investing, health is also the same thing. And with this, I think I won the bet and you take lesser leaves and finish the project. Right. You're very clever, sir. Really spins like 10,000.",

    "transcript_full": "Sir, I have created a new trading strategy. Wait, I'll show you. Hey, I have written and brought it. Please wait. Diwali Sir, Diwali is going on, so I have taken it to burst crackers. You leave all this… trading etc. Tell me one thing, do you have health insurance? Why? I mean, I am fit! You are fit, you are young, hence you do not need health insurance? Dude, I think this is the problem. Everyone who thinks they are young, thinks they don't need health insurance, this thinking will have to change a little. This is not correct. So in this episode we are going to talk about what is health insurance and why dear Abhishek should actually get one. And you guys should actually hit that subscribe button because we are workingquite hard in it, please go do it. Please! So Abhishek, So Abhishek, you do all this trading, why don't you have health insurance? Why is it needed? I mean basically, I'm still young, okay? I am going to the gym. Okay. And even if I have paid this premium, that too has gone waste, if not used? And I can earn more money in options. Dude Look! I don't think this is the right way. Let me show you something interesting, Dilkhush can I have the laptop? Look, let me show you something. Till the time it opens, tell me what do you think is the cost of taking care of your health. What will be the cost if you fall ill? So I don't fall ill, but if had hangover, I have to take Dispirin in the morning which costs Rs 30 or 40. Oh yeah! I love your overconfidence that how fit you are and blah, blah, blah... Look, let me show you. I am talking about medical procedures. Oh, okay? Let's forget for a while that you are very very fit. Although this is the wrong way to think about yourself, but just for this conversation. Okay. See this, This is the rising burden of cancer in India. This is how many people die, how many cases actually show up. So many millions of people. Yes, and this is actually a very large number, right? So even they did not think this happened to them. That's why you have insurance, in case something unfortunate happens. Okay, Okay. The second thing is if you look at this, In India, how many cardiovascular diseases are there, how many diabetes are there, how many respiratory diseases are there and how many communicable diseases are there. Many of these diseases are actually preventable. Our lifestyle is quite bad. I think India is one of the largest cases of CVDs in the world. Cardio vascular disease. That heart attack etc. Heart attack etc. Cardio related diseases. So these are all preventable. So you should take care of your health and nutrition, I know you take care. But also having health insurance covers for these, unforeseen events. Oh, you mean medical expenses, hospital bills and all that. What do you think the cost of the medicine will be? Now let's talk about an unforeseen event. Give me some example of an unforeseen circumstance in health. Uncle doing gym and he got an attack. Suffered a heart attack, okay. Let's look at this. Right, I have a bunch of examples over here, right from blood cancer to neck cancer, colon cancer, breast cancer, prostate. This is 75,000 to 1 lakh for 1 vial for breast cancer. So imagine how long this treatment lasts and how many vials it would take someone to actually get treated this is just the cost of the medicine. So procedure, It means, if you apply ten vials then it is 1 lakh into 10, which mean 10 lakh just for dose. I don't know how many vials it takes, but just imagine what is this cost. So you are saying twenty, thirty, forty rupees, I mean keep it a little aside. See colon cancer cost 50,000 per cycle. Neck cancer cost 1 Lakh per cycle. How much is heart attack? Also goes into, I mean if you look at lung cancer it's 1.2 lakh rupees for a certain kind of drug. The cost of heart related diseases could be this. This is also very expensive. Right? Also look at this. Cancer surgery is two lakhs, average cost of any cancer treatment is 10 lakh rupees, if lung transplant is done, the expense is twenty lakhs, where will this come from? Plus GST. Do you get that much bonus? Twenty lakhs? I can't give. Didn't even given ten thousand. You shouldn't say this. Cut it. My point is very simple. We are beyond the medical world. We don't know what the cost is? These costs are a lot and will drain you completely. Looking as it seems. Tell me one thing. We'll all get old right. Correct. There's no escaping it. That some point, you could get ill. It's possible. Let's assume it. Okay. If that happens and if twenty lakhs are spent, where will it come from? It will be a complete life saver for you. Retirement fund. Isn't it a problem? So, I think for mental piece, you should have some health insurance and also cover for critical critical illnesses as well. Okay, now I mean all this is fine but how to decide which health insurance? Let's talk about this a little later. But I think medical inflation is another thing, let it be completed. Okay. Now imagine, I think India had the highest medical inflation around 2020. Meaning, the cost of medical care and treatments. Medicine and processes. What's the return of NIFTY? CAGR? Put in comments. Please. It is around twelve percent. And medical inflation is around 10 to 14 percent. So we say compounding, we talk about equity compounding, crores of rupees will be made. But the cost of medical treatments will become crores of rupees as well if it's lakhs of rupees today. A few decades from now. So what is the protection? It's Health insurance. Or if you are very rich, you have exactly Rs 100 crore in your account. Then it's okay. No, I don't have that mcuh. I do not have too. I also have health insurance. But this is not only an ‘India’ thing, right? Look at China, Indonesia, Vietnam, Philippines, they have medical inflation there too. But, in India its highest. Meaning, it keeps varying. So yeah, compounding is happening here too, but in different industries. Okay. So, how do I apply for this insurance? Means, how do I get this insurance? This Health insurance? So, see, we can't cover all of the details in this one episode. So, this is to get you started. So there are two ways. First get an agent who you can speak to, who has been doing it for ten to twenty years. That agent will guide you, tell you, they'll get some commission as well. And in exchange for that commission he is going to hopefully give you great service. So he will spend time with you. I've heard of agents coming to the hospital, when such a claim comes, they fight. So talk within your circle and find that correct agent who probably takes care of many people. Generally works on referral. And if I don't find an agent. I mean, if you search, you will find him. If you don't find it and you don't want to go that route. The second is just buying it online. That is easier. So there are some aggregators online. Here are a few examples. Go to their website, they have connections, they aggregate all the health insurances and they help you buy it. So the thing that has a little personal touch in it gets reduced a little bit as far as I know but you are able to buy it online. So these are the two ways. And if you don't want to go to an aggregator and there is a particular health insurance company that for some reason you think is right, go to their website, fill the form and it is done. Okay, that's good. I understood it sir. Tell me a system that tells me, that this insurance is the best, that is, with whatever parameters it has. Oh like a trading system or an investing system. Yes, I mean which is best. I don't think it works like that but can make a checklist. This check list is on your screen and you can read it here on your screen. Okay. If you follow all this, this is a great way to start. So one thing is that a co-payment offer comes that you reduce the premium, you put in a little money, some money will be given by the insurance company and your claim will be done. Don't take this contri like system. But it is not known how much in the bill of ten lakhs, they can ask to give 5 Lakhs in that bill. Say that,’ No, I don't want copayment. So I want full on that.’ Secondly, these people put restrictions on room rent. So whether you are put in general or deluxe or super deluxe, there are some restrictions on it. But they keep that in writing. Yes, it is not visible, this is called,’Room Capping.’ So there should not be any capping on room types. So that is one thing you should look at. Second is that for every disease they put a limit. So the insurance can be of ten lakhs, but it can be that they are covering a particular illness for 10,000 rupees. Or 1 Lakh rupees. And if there is any extra expenditure then I need to give it. That is wrong because we are taking insurance when something very critical happens. Isn't it? So when it becomes critical then the insurance company will say, ‘Sorry, this is not covered.’ So that shouldn't happen. I think you should look at it a little carefully. Okay. Then there is coverage of pre and post - hospitalization care. Meaning consultation etc. What does pre - hospitalization mean? No, for example your surgery is done, So in hospitalization, let's suppose the insurance covers it while you are hospitalized or your leg surgery is done. God forbid! Someone else's. Happened with someone else. After the discharge, he will have some medicines, maybe physiotherapy. So who will cover that cost? The insurance should do this. So you should make sure that there is post hospitalization care as well. So that's interesting. Then there is low waiting period. What is this? Means, I applied for the bill. No, it's not that. So the insurance actually covers some existing diseases. Okay? This could be anything. This could be thyroid related, blood pressure etc. So they put a waiting period on it that if you have something related to it then it'll be covered only after three years, or it is covered after two years. So it shouldn't be too long. It's fair to have some waiting period but it can't be too long. So it should be a little lower. Typically, anywhere between 2 to 4 years is fine. and then everything else you can actually see on the screen. And you can save a little tax friend. Rs.25,000 per year gets deducted from your taxable income at 80D, if you actually have health insurance. Oh that's nice. I'll just do… what I'll do. Give me your phone, I will just buy a health insurance. Hey! Wait a minute, just wait a little brother. Let's talk about the red flags. Okay? What is something that can go.. Red flags in insurance? Red flags are everywhere, wherever there is money there are red flags. So the first thing is you should make sure you don't lie. So if you look at this form over here. Here if you have written that.. I don't smoke but I smoke. Yes, correct. Do you smoke? Lighter is to light crackers, Sir. Sure! And if you get some health related disease to smoking , you will not get the claim. Because I didn't tell them. Because you did not tell them the truth and the premium adjusts according to what you said. So many people say that I will not tell this thing, I will hide it. This should not be done. If at the time of claim it is verified that you lied, the premium would have been adjusted, and the contract would have become null and void and they can say, I will not pay anything. But the premium I paid is gone. Yes. So never ever lie. The point of it is if you have to pay even five hundred extra. Don't lie. If you smoke, say it, is there any pre existing disease, say it, they will cover it, hopefully, if you read through it. Second, fill the form yourself. Imagine a situation you are really healthy. Right. I am healthy but, Sure. And you don't smoke and something happens to you and you have to go and take a claim. But the claim gets rejected. Ask me why? Rejected. Why? Because it's not for Abhishek Rathor, it's for Abhisek Rathor. ‘H’ was missed. While filling the form, if you miss writing your name properly, your date of birth properly, or anything they will say this is someone else, you are not this person, your claim will be rejected. This is a problem. Hey! Isn’t the photo affixed on the form? I don't know but you have to make sure when the form is filled, make sure there is no human error. I think this is an edge case but it could happen and your money will go down the drain. Yes, same. Gone! Zero! So you have to make sure these two things are actually you take care of. Okay, perfect, I got it. So I don't have to lie, I'll pay premium on time. There is also tax benefit. Right. Sir, Can I get some return after ten years from it. I mean I'm paying this much premium every year, isn't it? Yes, every ten years these people will give you one crore rupees as a return. This is not true. This is absolutely false. So people think they will take a health insurance and there will be some investment aspect to it. They'll get something after 5 or 10 years. Dont ever do it. Take a pure health insurance, pure life insurance. That's for a different episode. Don't mix investment and insurance, both have different functions. Okay sir, got it. Now I'll buy a good health insurance. Nice, and All the Best! and if you thought this was good. Comment guys, do you have health insurance? Give me a Yes or a No. Yes or a No. I will buy one. You will, Right? I will comment also. So Abhishek, there are a lot of nuances to how you should buy a health insurance and we have not covered the details at all. This was a way to get you started. Way to get the right mindset. So the mindset is now correct. Correct! So here is a quick checklist for you to see go through it, pause the video, understand it. And if we want to hear more conversations around taxes, loans, maybe even life insurance, then put it in the comments. Amazing topic suggestions, put the topic names. Hey what, where are you going? Burst crackers. Burst crackers? Guys please put in the comments below. Abhishek does not smoke because his father is watching this and I don't smoke but I am going to burst crackers. You also come. Yes, I will make a phone call to your father, just wait!",

    "transcript_full": "today we're going full crazy and creating a five stock stock portfolio using this bake has been obsessed with this book right here and this line that says bnes can create a stock portfolio and beat fund managers now is that even possible what do you think I don't know let's find [Music] out okay guys hold up hold up before we begin this game's pretty simple we have two contestants and we have this really sharp arrow we're going to shoot and whatever stock We Touch will be part of your portfolio we have two guys from the office we have vasu and we have abishek and the winner of this game is going to get this Farmhouse to party tonight so let the games begin guys before you start Basu what's your what's your strategy sir I don't have any strategy uh nifty50 huh I'm aiming for Index Fund why why index fund index will outperform everything best interesting what's your strategy here which stock so I really don't care what my arrow hits okay right I have read this research this booked by Burton yeah yeah if monkeys could do it why can't I so you think you'll win of course so don't worry I'll just rent the property to him you get the paperwork done well you going to buy this place of course over confidence okay guys let's go what do you think he's going to win man I think we're entertaining abishek a little too much he's not going to [Music] win the arrows are not even hitting the board guys I mean as in [Music] pfolio who won we I did of course where do have to sign uh to buy this this is not how it works we will take all your stocks make a portfolio back test see after all the results who won which companies died which companies didn't so let's do the audit pack up let's go okay welcome to their portfolio audit so we have portfolio one and portfolio 2 oh sorry portfolio one and portfolio 2 we can see portfolio 1 has made a 4 and a half% cagr very nice clapping clapping bu% cagr okay it's not back only four yeah um and you have done minus 0.5% actually what around you've lost about half% every year okay so so let's let's go through this okay now I want you to see this look at some of the stock cagrs over here let's let's start with you okay so here we can see one one one company has done minus almost - 10% another has done almost -4 a half% and this is cagr right um let's that's the stocks haven't moved at all and they're giving a negative return this is really unfortunate do you notice something about this company it took a reverse care this company doesn't exist anymore that's and and I'll explain what this is and for you over here we have all these large cap companies sort of yeah one of them hasn't done well at all you know what the company this is and the others actually gave a decently positive return and you ended up with four and almost 4 and a half% c not bad AB I want to ask you some question I have a list of stocks over here can you see see this list of stocks over here now these are stocks from 2000 around 2010 have you heard of this stock no and V have you seen this stock no and what about this one no and have you seen this one no okay these were really famous stocks a long time ago and if we traveled back in time and you were there in news and everyone said dude these are the hot stocks of the day and you know retailers would be like comp so you know what this is called survivorship bias oh you will never see this list in 2023 because you look at nifty 50 nifty 100 they will not be there hot stocks they will not be there volume gainers they will not any list you look at these stocks will not be there you know why because you know the answer survivorship biased they've not survived they died to if you look at the best performing stocks in 2023 and then back test them result well yes correct right correct in your list those stocks which died don't exist correct so that bias is there right so I sneakily put a bunch of stocks over there which actually uh don't exist today and that's why your portfolio does this because there is you know survivorship it it's because it's real because it's real and I just hit particularly those and you hit it so you know there's some probability playing over here good surprise okay so that means if I make a portfolio in 2023 right some of those stocks will actually not survive probably let's say 10 years from now is that what you're saying what do you think yeah I think that would happen correct so there's nothing you can do about it we can't predict it the only way is diversify and some of those stocks will go to zero or not move at all and that's completely fine and this must also happen with the big investors and fund managers 100% actually if you look at all the large investors they all sort of diversify their Investments but if you look at the successful ones they will have a large holding in some companies ju Buffett companies like Coke etc for raak janal we can see Titan so just like some will die some will completely outperform and that's the way the market Works nobody knows what's going to happen yes I think I think one of my losing companies was held by Mr jinuna Perfect so this is called saip bias when you are back testing something in 2023 you may only look at the successful companies because the companies that died you will not find the list anywhere though your list itself is biased your back test is biased and there is survivorship bias in that list the reason why both these portfolios didn't perform extremely well is because some of the stocks which did not survive were included in that board over there and we learned how survivorship bias Works nice learned something very nice very nice put it in the comments if you didn't know this the second thing I want to tell you so I've read that book by Burton yeah tell me about that research I mean did I do anything wrong which so I think you're comparing the research you read and you've been talking about so long versus what just happened correct so in the book we had the research done and the research is documented and proven that a thousand companies may say these monkeys selected 30 companies and that portfolio actually beat all the fund managers this is the story so it feels like if you randomly pick 30 stocks you can beat the market or beat fund managers correct but I didn't win and you thought you randomly picked those companies correct so I think these are two different situations in the monkey situation those were 1,000 companies the second thing is in those 1,000 companies there'll be some micro cap companies maybe trading for a couple of cents couple of PESA equivalent to us which go to thousands or tens of thousands of rupees I'm actually saying dollars and that return could be so high that it will skew the portfolio so my question to you guys is this if your life saving is X and you have to put it in this unknown company just market cap 100 no no no would you be able to do it no just because you read a book no right so maybe that's why the monkeys won but that doesn't mean you should pick stocks on at random so you're done yeah perfect the second thing I was going to tell you forget about your returns lousy returns half% CHR minus I don't remember plus 4 and a half% plus think about Nifty Nifty is the index the Nifty has given 133% cagr I know but play the game though Nifty beat you a lot and all you had to do was just hold on to and nifty 50 nifty 100 both have given roughly the same cagr but I think by doing this you understood that unless you really want to learn to pick stocks and become a Peter Lynch or any of these people and actually beat the market which is possible by the way but requires you to study and learn a lot the simplest thing for a retail investor to do is this just buy an index fund and hold it for a long period of time um the power over here is time if you hold it for a long period of time and the best would be like a sip every month for a long period of time so when you pick an index fund your survivorship bias is actually taken care of oh tell me how there won't be any companies that die off probably in nifty50 top 50 does that mean top 50 companies don't die maybe they do but they might get thrown out of nifty50 right exactly you know how the calculation happens right yeah how so imagine the top 50 companies by market cap is nifty50 which means if some company's market cap reduces the 51st company becomes 50th and this gets gets thrown out this gets like 51 it's not in 5050 anymore so it keeps replacing it keeps changing as per the market cap so the survivorship bias is taken care of it's like a algo right so we'll always be holding top 50 companies whatever no matter who they are so that that's one advantage there's an algo inside it you've not picked a set of 50 stocks the set of 50 stocks keeps evolving so my point is very simple if you don't want to put the effort to research find a stock balance exit Etc and don't have the time to do it simply buy an index fund if you do have the time to research and build like vasu does over here I know you like picking stocks um and so do I you can create your own portfolio but you'll have to you'll have to have a little bit of obsession because you have to figure things out tell me what kind of person are you are you an abishek who still doesn't know what to do are you a vasu who will only invest in Index Fund or are you a pratique who will pick your own stocks and create portfolio put it in the comments say something index monkey see I didn't get the Farmhouse but you should subscribe right now bro close [Laughter] for",

    "transcript_full": "hi you need my suraka CCH you see this once you apply snake oil every day 700 a.m. and 7 p.m. twice a day for the next 6 months you will emanate a glob you will become taller women ha no problem you see these mansion mansion one Mansion two all mine you want to change your life follow me order now tired of this man [Music] Abid I'm having a lot of fun my life is fantastic you saw me sell that yeah people eat it up bro yeah you see how many users I have people love it they want to change their lives yep but I need to turn this into into a fora how am I doing this you come to the right place my [Music] [Applause] man so Pik let me explain to you something whatever you are doing over there that is selling stuff to people is a Formula okay I have studied hundreds of hours of salesman like you selling snake oil formula what is snake oil salesman mean meet Clark Stanley he made lots of money by selling snake oil which claimed to heal everything back in the 1800s Chinese immigrants working on the railroad brought snake oil all the way from China and it was used for things like arthritis but then some folks started selling fake snake oil maybe because it sounded really exotic and since it was difficult to get no one really refuted it I mean people's greed blinded them to believe that they could become smarter taller and even prettier just by applying a little bit of snake oil among the snake oil salesman the most infamous was Clark Stanley he claimed that the product had real rattlesnake oil but it was just a big fat lie he claimed that it was the strongest and best lmit known for pain and lameness and this is just a list of things he claimed that snake oil could solve rheumatism shiaa lame back toothaches swellings Frost bites bruises and the list goes on on and on strangely he also claimed that it's good for both man and Beast and provides instant relief just like magic and just like magic it too turned out to be a big illusion and soon the usfda came knocking on his door and put this Man Behind Bars since then snake oil salesmen have taken many shapes and forms and expanded to the entire world but it's not snake oil anymore it could be fake medicines fake courses we've really come such a long way and this is a lesson from the past reminding us to be smart and not believing anyone's fake promises and Tall claims so the formula is very simple you can actually decode it into five parts and just by following this guide you can set up any business in which you fool people so we'll start with step one and step one this is the most important part you have to take something that people are really desperate for like people are really really desperate for this and the fact that they don't have it is something which makes them very insecure and ashamed that's interesting what people are insecure and they really really want so balding hair obesity they want to lose weight body maybe want like a six-pack uh it could be um you know getting lucky with women last longer when they're running in a marathon right it could also be some stuff like just be generally fit it could be what else money oh money want to be super super rich successful in business successful in stock markets successful in could be image also right people respect me because I have XYZ car and I have status interesting it could be like a title also so they join a cult anyway it could be these things you have to pick something like that you can't pick something don't say stuff like you know it'll make you a better writer nobody cares right it correct your grammar who no one cares nobody pay ASE is universal everyone wants who doesn't want to be rich everybody got it so you pick this that's the first thing you have to start with picking something which people are really desperate about if you don't have it you're insecure and it it's there's a dark dark turn to it like people who are having like very terminal diseases and all right they really want to get rid of that and you know live right even that comes into this thing so now we'll get to the second part you're ready for this right yes very important you have to make a very very tall promise don't say medium level things don't say mediocre things don't say expectations which are realistic so if I say you will make 12% a year from the stock oh 11.5% double 5 10 100 x 100 x in a short period of time really big money good good money you can't say k dude you know what you're driving an hatchback now we'll get you into SUV you have to say no no Ferrari 4 58 it times five yeah times five right you you have to say it's like the LIE is so large you won't believe that it can't be a lied must be some truth to it now here's the thing right this is also important the point number three is it has to be easy your entire transformation if you if so let's let's look at this right if I tell you pratik I'll get you to six packs come join a journey with me where you wake up every morning do su namaskar then you are empty fast then you come running with me then we hit the gym we do 50 squats 50 push-ups 50 press ups I don't know what ups are there ET I if if I knew I would look different right I I can't I can't say all this right it has to be something very very easy to do which plays on your laziness enter the dark Shady world of snake oil salesman in India where Promises of quick riches and miraculous Transformations come in all forms have you ever seen in this the weight loss belt also called the slimming belt these belts promised a Fit Body and all you had to do was sit in front of the television wear the belt and lose weight easy easy but like everything that sounds too good to be true this was an example of the classic snake Oil Modified for the 21st century but wait there's more real estate scams Ponzi schemes mlms and network marketing certain kind of chit fund fake courses fake herbal medicines and even fake J the list is endless but you and I know how to figure these guys out don't we like earlier this year SE shut down a telegram channel that claimed to specialize in penny stocks and about 50,000 subscribers fell for their tips guys come on but what was the scam here well the admins actually bought the stocks in advance and as soon as the tips went out immediately sold their shares to the unsuspecting subscribers and well earned a quick Buck while the subscribers went empty-handed but there's another snake oil pitch that's super popular in India the infamous you'll find in every corner people have used this before and you will love it too herbal oil scheme these are the stuff of newspapers where a ni Nigerian prince pedals a herbal oil that is supposedly made with something natural let's say honey or something herbal and just like Stanley's oil they two claim to solve pretty much anything under the sun all you had to do is put a little bit of herbal oil as we navigate these mky Waters of deception we should arm ourselves with skepticism and a little bit of pessimism too don't you think and whether it's a promise of Success Through a dubious course or the a of a magical herbal remedy let's pause and question and verify because these are the tools we all need in this age of information overload the fourth magic ingredient right and and pay attention whether you are like a person who's detecting this fraud or doing this fraud right hopefully people who are doing this fraud are not watching it but I'll give it anyway I I say this with a heavy heart but I'm going to say this anyway you have to price it damn cheap or oh it cannot be expensive it has to be really really really affordable and cheap interesting I'm going to let you have a go at where you found this before so I think uh any any of these scam things you see they will cost anywhere between a few rupees in a tent on the side of the road or online if you buy for 2 3 4,000 rupees I've also seen them say wor 35 but it's now 20,000 but for you 5,000 if you call now p in the next 10 minutes 100 rupees when people buy it I don't know have you you've been through that era right on TV people are selling stuff to you on television right I would name the channel okay but they're selling stuff to you and the entire show is just an adver to buy this thing I know the show one of these shows me very long time ago there was a memory enhancer and the show was beautiful I'll tell you why because they didn't tell me actual product ttim I'm going to I'm going to test it right though you bought the pill right yes I I do you remember the name of the pill I don't remember the name of the it was a memory enhancer what do you think about that is it priced on purposly low so that people say I tried but yeah in we have a very famous prb right if you lose you lose a coconut uh if you gain you gain a coconut tree and M so yeah this is a very very good example uh so that's the fourth formula right corre what's the fifth the fifth and the last one right is you have to have proof of success you cannot do this without some social validation so so if you look at it right every business coach every stock market tipster every fraud in the country they are always shooting their video inside either a Mercedes or a BMW or an Audi right I mean rented but always shoot while the logo on that Mercedes center is visible in your camera hi guys I'm going to teach you how to improve my business I'm on my way to go to office you can see the person is lifestyle coaches are the same thing 2008 there was this guy I won't name him but he was also stock market coach stock market coaches abroad us and really young guy in front of a mansion and a swimming pool and he would say join my group I think it was a mastermind group they call it and you pay ax dollar and through my talking to you you will lead the life that I lead and that to me that is the OG business coach that I followed and then after a few weeks I was like dude this can't be true at all and just stopped it but every week I think a new coach is born all of these are human things none of these are Indian things no no these are not Indian these are human insecurities transformational wanting I know that's not a word uh price should be low Mass Appeal and what's the last one proof of proof of so that's a marketing what do you have to lose if you like the episode so far hit that like And subscribe and don't forget to comment even if 100 people are gullible enough to fall for it you're making free money of them correct that's the whole like you don't have to convince everyone right you get a few people to believe you looking at your proof of success correct so that's the better I would say business and finance right so if someone wants to start a small business MLM is a very good example for example um and what they do is they say look I am going to transform your life all those five things you said buy this 10 lakh rupe worth of product from me so you're not really paying me you're actually buying the product but actually the 10 lakh is going to the dude you're you're buying it from correct and you sell it to someone else and so on and so forth so we discussed that snake o salesman to be successful have to price their products really low that's nice for the consumer isn't it I mean it's a low price and even if you lost something I mean who really cares for a few hundred rupees what's the problem let me explain the first is think about financial ruin one example of a 58-year-old retired Insurance Company employee lost 31 lakh rupees after being scammed in a telegram group involving investing in a crypto wallet and some of these scams can actually take you to financial ruin because they bait you with greed second there is emotional distress like this couple from Andra Pradesh committed suicide together because they were constantly being harassed by predators of loan apps this may seem too far-fetched but one Google search and you'll see that this has now become fairly common and these scams play to our dreams and vulnerabilities third this trust erosion deceptive schemes and snake oil pitches corrode trust in genuine opportunities imagine a country where every opportunity is most likely a scam what would that Society evolve into I mean we have an interesting proxy like Colombia the consumer confidence index is not low it's negative this means consumers in Colombia don't trust anything that comes out from the country so even if there's an entrepreneur trying to create a genuine product nobody will believe them then there are legit health risks think about the pandemic the unsuspecting vulnerable scared at risk of the covid virus will buy a snake oil thinking they'll be cured but actually might not take a vaccine think about how risky this becomes I think the scariest thing about snake oil salesman is this if no one puts a stop to it an entire Society may just create mistrust but we want to create a trustworthy Society don't we and as we nav navigate through these problems let's be vigilant question promises that Glitter too brightly and work together to build a society where trust is earned and the exploitation just finds no place so prati let me ask you a question have you understood the Magic ingredients yes you understood how it works yes I think so you're ready to set up your own telegram Channel ready now I have a question and this is a very important question what do you think will happen when somebody finds out that you have been running a fraud thing right and calls you out on social media interesting okay so I think the way to think about this is going back to your five points right the first is you're picking something that's an insecurity of that person so let's say height okay um so now you did not get the 3 in you were promised on your height will you really go on social media and say I'm not Toler you're already insecure about this you can say the same thing about he hair maybe good looks maybe not being able to attract women if that's the case so I think that insecurity because you've picked an insecure person uh he will not talk about it publicly because uh well that's the nature of the game prik you're a good student 10 points you're absolutely right it bloody embarrassing to go online and nobody's going to do that right correct so this is the first line of defense which you as a future Hamer is going to have love it now let me so you you're more confident about this business feeling better this is nice so there's no refund rate you do realize that I'll take a 10% finders fee for giving you this brilliant idea from your telegram Channel sure you're talking to a scam still of course I'll give you 10% thank you uh okay last question last very last question see all of this agreed but there is still going to be one of two Really Brave really good people who go on social who will go on social media and say prati scammer he said it'll change he promised me there's Al you're not getting it dude I'm running a business right and like all the people beh behind me I am standing on the shoulder of giants okay I didn't get that I will learn from them there are people before me who have done better correct so I'll just follow what as scammers as scammers as scammers as scammers so let's learn from that okay so one um we'll make sure we have um an IT department in inside the office the the four or five social media guys who will just go and pose as an army and say no this guy is great this guy is an idiot it has worked for us the second can be because I'm attracting uh because these scamsters will run social media channels which are very polarized right so uh think about this no one will go and say something that's um sort of right sort of wrong they'll do one end of the spectrum they extreme success polarized right so they'll say men are best for example High masculinity or or they'll pick you must make millions of dollars or they'll pick something on an extreme scale hustle mode on hustle mode on you will you will attack those kinds of people they will defend the hell out of anyone who says anything wrong time correct so that's the second line and third I've also heard dude that um a lot of these guys at least abroad I don't know about India have these thugs you like gundas like gundas and the gundas will can go and physically threaten someone who becomes very big nuisance value I mean decent inv right if you're making so much money might as well invest in four bodyguards and it's not expensive considering the payoff yeah it's very very lucrative considering the payoff so this is how the the the the the fort can be secured basically intimidate anybody who will send so it works right which is fair because you have so much more money so many more resources so many more people so much more social media time everyone else is busy bro the customers are busy right because they have their lives to get on to oh my god dude now you're scaring me yeah what did you all learn from this please put it as comment I'd love to see what your summary of this you are going to become a bigger monster than I thought I will create anyway I think a lot of us have seen getrich schams online offline and it's been happening for maybe thousands of years the basic premise of what we discussed is the same right the vehicle may change so this may happen in the metaverse in the future but the basic five things we discussed will always be there and there is no shortcut to it and this is my appeal to you right see I know that a lot of people who watching this are not people who fall for this right a lot of you are people who are doing well in life your middle income you have all your needs met you are not going to go pay money to somebody who says they'll give you a pill which will make you thinner or get six packs right but there are others out there who are not exactly people like us if you are watching this please please please spread awareness of the kind of scam which is happening in our society Now by manipulating the people who are most vulnerable to it so pratik now that you have a successful snake oil selling business right I have a vision for you for the future PS reptilian products private limited okay and we will IPO it IPO huh yes hit that like And subscribe and in the next episode we'll talk about iOS yes",

    "transcript_full": "oh Namaste Namaste I have to talk to you about something very serious investment options basically you do Equity Etc now do you know what gives better than Equity returns I don't know if there's a best asset class uncle but chit funds chit funds yeah yeah very simple see the chitty is out in this register I'll put your name here whether the chit comes out or not you will make 25% returns guaranteed 25% guaranteed returns Uncle I don't think think you understand how chit funds work I have been doing this for a long time everyone over here has made a lot of money Uncle you are Miss selling what what this is not how chit funs work guaranteed I mean how can you say this this is complet this is how chit funs work you don't understand chit funs are actually decently popular in fact lot of people are participating in it have participated or want to in fact we've heard of all these big businessmen do scams but you've probably not heard of chit funds doing scams as well and like any Financial product there are pitfalls as well 30,000 crores are you kidding me this is an actual issue so in this episode we'll de influence chit funs we'll talk about the good we'll talk about the bad cuz certainly nobody else is so let's get [Music] started so let's understand what a chit fund is over here I have my little chit fund of four individuals four members why don't you all pull in your money notice they all putting 1,000 rupees each equally for this month we have a total chit of 4,000 rupees now what happens with this money remember this is a savings and return scheme for these guys so this person over here will now bid in a reverse auction weird right let's see what happens bid 35 35 500 in a pool of 4,000 okay 3,000 3,000 bid the bids are going lower okay he doesn't want to bid this time 4,000 4,000 interesting now the person who has bid the lowest not the highest the lowest which is 3,000 actually wins the pot but he doesn't get the 4,000 he wins only what he bid for that's 3,000 so what happens with this extra 1,000 that's left over well after I get my little commission from this as a foreman and this amount which is left over which is distributed amongst everyone is called a dividend it's how they earn now notice the person who does not bid keeps earning throughout all the months so the longer you hold you'll actually earn something from this spt notice it's just the community they're not adding or creating anything together it's just these people working to save and then hopefully earn something over a long period of time remember a chit fund is completely legal and has been around for a really long time in fact it's governed by the 1982 chit funds act so now let's go to month number two and see what happens so members put in your contribution same thing 1,000 rupees each but this time let's see how the auction goes he cannot actually bid because he's already won once 3500 3500 he's not bidding 2500 2500 excellent so he has the lowest bid and he takes the 2500 so 1,000 1,000 another 500 this is yours and this money that's left over will be divided equally amongst everyone except him of course this time notice that the money left over is a little more than last time and notice he because he didn't participate and he he didn't win they actually earned something that month this is why chit funds are really popular you know what else is popular the 01 Fest here you can meet like-minded people like all these guys it's happening on the 28th of April in Bangalore at jahal Palace to get the free passes you need to prove that you're a 01 fan so go to 01 byzero da.com complete the mission and earn your pass see you there now back to the episode on the advantages of chit funds some advantages are that the unbanked people who do not have access to a bank account or just may not trust it use this place another reason is that since it's within the community it feels familiar it feels nice it feels warm it doesn't feel too transactional third everyone can participate there is no collateral required and fourth Financial discipline not only is the paperwork minimal you also are forced to put in some amount every single month now imagine someone who is forced socially to put in something because everyone around them is putting it's a great way for them to set aside some money and place it somewhere and hopefully save for a long time and you're probably wondering what happen happens when no one actually bids then what well in that case they take out a chit literally and whoever wins that chit actually gets the pot that's why it's called a chit fund now let's imagine 15 16 20 months go by and these guys think that this is trustworthy this is working well and they keep pulling in their money again and again and again as the trust goes high and one day in this fraudulent chit fund I assembl the money hey guys check that out hey hey where they go where they go money money so like I said all chit funds are legal but there are some chit funds which start with the angle to dup people and we'll cover those the first one is a multi-level marketing structure over here one agent appoints 10 agents those 10 agents appoint another 10 agents each and so on and so forth because it creates a pyramid scheme the Miss selling happens here each agent can have a commission up to 40% now when you incentivize an agent with so much commission he will be desperate to say whatever is needed to sell this chit fund to unsuspecting customers and usually this agent might say guaranteed returns he might say p double he might say this is the best investment with zero risk so on and so forth this is called Miss selling and unsuspecting customers think it's okay this guy is from the community this guy is well respected everyone knows where he lives H it's fine he's not a corporate he's not from a large company there is not much paperwork let me trust him so if you're investing in a chit fund you have to make sure that this multi-level agent structured does not exist because it's not supposed to happen in a chit fund I already showed you how a chit fund actually works you don't need an agent reporting to another agent sometimes One agent can have a 100 agents under him and this is not even the half of it once there was a chit fund a real chit fund which had 70 lakh agents in fact there was another chit fund really famous called the sarda chit fund which took away tens of thousands of crores and once the entire house of cards fell I think hundreds of Agents took their own lives because of the societal pressure so make sure if you're ever investing in a chit fund or know someone who's doing it this multi-level marketing agent format should not be in that fund the second kind of risk is that a chit fund is not operating like a chit fund but a Ponzi scheme a Ponzi scheme is a very common fraudulent way of taking money from investors in many different kinds of investment vehicles and it also happens in chit funds here's how it works what if the chit fund said I will give you guaranteed returns I guarantee a 50% return year on year or 100% return year on year no matter what how does that happen well what it'll simply do is when a new investor comes takes that money and gives it to someone who's been invested for a long time so I'm simply taking someone else's cash and giving it to them we're not actually following the rules of the chit fund and this is not sustainable the only way to sustain this is that new investors keep coming in again and again and again so their focus becomes on user testimonials making a lot of money and second a lot of advertising I'm talking about a crazy amount of advertising celebrities events the works it will look like a shining diamond in the sky and more people keep entering the Ponzi continues the guaranteed returns happens and for some reason this diamond in the sky suddenly stops getting new and investors now when you stop getting new investors you can't pay the old investors the guaranteed returns where does the money come from you have more liabilities and less assets the only thing for it to happen is that the House of Cards Falls and the owners of the chit fund Take the Money and Run so make sure if anyone is considering a chit fund it should never offer a guaranteed return or a return that seems too high from what the market is offering it has to be at Market or near Market it can't be above it because that's something wrong but remember no Financial product whether regulated unregulated whatever can ever offer a guaranteed return that's something that's just not allowed because returns is what the market decides the Third Kind of risk in a chit fund are ghost subscribers now when we had those four members on this table you could see them and you could see them actually investing but what if I added a bunch of people with fake IDs trying to show you and convince you that this fund is really really popular many people are investing in it so this is one kind of risk identity risk or the ghost subscriber risk I'm not sure how we could actually beat this kind of risk but if you do put it in the comments I'd love to understand how we could be a little more transparent about this in fact one of the top 50 chit funds in the country had an allegation from the C saying that they have G subscribers so in summary here are some red flags of a chit fund the first are unbelievable returns if the company promises abnormally High returns be skeptical the second is lack of transparency if a company provides limited or unclear information about the company's operations and financials be skeptical the third is the most obvious pressure to recruit if someone comes in and tries to get as many investors as they can really aggressively these sales tactics generally put so much pressure on the agents that something goes wrong with the fund no one should be so aggressive in trying to get new investors missing or delayed payments if participants are experiencing delays in payments of promised returns be skeptical and unregistered companies operating without proper registration or licenses is obviously not good you want the chit fund to be legal under the ACT a bunch of people actually asked us to cover chit funds in these comments over here so we actually did an entire episode about it to be honest a lot of people don't to chit funds I mean I've never done chit funds but the truth is when we were actually researching this we went around the office and turns out someone's brother or sister or uncle had actually invested in a chit fund and they actually lost money and it felt good and warm to them because he that person was part of the community that's when we thought finding the right topic we can't do in this office we'll have to listen to your comments so thank you for saying that but if you have other topics that you think we should de influence please tell us in the comments and if you're not sure look at the playlist we've covered everything from MLM schemes to mutual funds you name it so help us make a nice playlist and tell me what you want to cover don't forget to like And subscribe and see you in the next episode [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] m",

    "transcript_full": "Guys, I have an announcement. 01 is shutting down. I know surprising, but that's the reality. We've been creating videos for so many months now, but unfortunately, at least not as much as we expected. We love you all and we thank you for your support, but this video is the last video of 01's channel. That's the scam we did in the office to scare the bijes out of everyone that 01 has shut down. And with those reactions, a lot of them actually believed it. But that's not the scary part. The scary part is the video that you saw was completely deep fake. It wasn't me. We didn't shoot it. It was created by a computer by people who've never done this before. We figured it out in just a day or two. Imagine what a real scamster can do with just creating a deep fake. Talking about artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence. You can't trust the voice. You can't trust the photo and you can't trust the video anymore. All it takes is just 30 seconds of your voice. People are just getting fooled by these things. It decision makers in India continue to express concerns over deep fake technology. This is a very big threat to democracy. Prime Minister Modi takes note calls deep fakes one of the biggest threats faced. I think if this technology goes wrong, it can go quite wrong. So in this episode, we're going to talk about the good and the bad cuz clearly the internet will deep fake you. Let's get started. I want you to tell me which of these videos are fake. Okay, how about this one? Or this one? I'm sure that was difficult. Some of them were a little difficult to tell whether they were fake or real. And this is how good the tech has become. And the problem is it's getting better and better. The gap between what's real and what's not is slowly just blurring out. And we don't know what's generated and what's just plain fake. Manipulating video is nothing new. We've been doing it for decades, probably close to a 100red years. In fact, when video started, we used to have film strips and we could cut or splice those positive film strips to create a new version from what was originally shot. And that gave us a new version and more control over how we could change perception of reality via this new medium. And then came computers, which obviously changed everything. It could create fire out of nowhere. In fact, one of my favorite movies, Forest Gump, run, Forest, run, where Tom Hanks meets all these people from different parts of history, was completely made using visual effects. Today, it's slightly easier to do, but back then it was groundbreaking. And of course, the entire entertainment industry, visual effects industry benefits from this tech because it makes cost of production cheaper. In fact, this movie had multiple deep fake technologies used to dub it into different languages. Another good use of this deep tech is David Beckham's campaign around malaria. And this entire campaign you see in front of you was created using deep technology. Malaria isn't just any disease. This was really useful and perhaps many many lives were saved. So first let's talk about GANs. I can't say GANs. So how so why have deep fakes become so realistic all of a sudden? How did we go from this to this? And the answer is here. The generative adversarial network. It's basically a new way of computing all of this and generating these images. On one side we have a generator and on the other side we have a discriminator. Now the job of this algorithm is to generate an image based on the training data we've given. Let's say an image of an orange and through that image of an orange the generator will generate an image like this. The discriminator will say this does not look like an orange and keep saying no until we get a picture of an orange. That's why once these both nodes agree this looks exactly like an orange. So the reason it's called deep fake because it uses deep learning technology and of course you can face swap people using this technology and fake because well you know it's fake. And speaking of fakes, the biggest problem and misuse of this entire tech is just sexualizing women. In fact, 98% of all deep fakes right now are around the adult industry and 99% are geared towards women. It may or may not be completely explicit, but even something as simple as this video where Rashmika's face was swapped with someone else without a permission and this video goes viral. This was deep tech but done without a permission. Should this really be allowed? Shouldn't, right? It's not like deep fake just came in 2024. Deep fakes have been around for many years now, but the tech has become a little more efficient. Which is why when you look at deep fakes history, you'll see that very famous actors and actresses, deep fakes, were created four or 5 years ago because there were ton of information of them on the internet, in the movies, on YouTube. But now with a new efficient technology, just a few videos can create a deep fake. And that's why this could now be anyone's game. And the problem is even bigger because now there are certain ways on the internet where you can put in a few photos and just take out a deep fake. This obviously is too easy and can be misused and probably is right now. And towards the end of this video, we'll talk about how we can spot a deep fake. Actually, someone in our office got a call from a lady. Hello sir, this is from ABC. Okay. second. Now, luckily, this guy is at 01, so he knew this is a scam and shut it down. And we found out that this was a man using voice modulation and pretending to be a woman. Now, to be honest, you're probably not surprised about this. This sounds like a pretty basic scam, but think about what you could do with this voice cloning technology. Imagine this. Your parents are sitting at home and they get a call on WhatsApp with a display picture of a police officer. And they pick up the call. The person introduces himself as an officer and says, \"Your son/daughter has been found guilty in drunk driving and you need to give us 70,000 rupees for us to let him go because you know this is an illegal offense, etc., etc.\" And they scare the hell out of your parents. The parents now know this could be a scam. But suddenly they hear your voice. You're crying. You're in pain. And you say, \"Mommy, I really need this. I need to get out of here.\" Now in that panic, your parents will probably transfer that money only later on to find out that your son/daughter is completely fine and that voice was not his hers. It was just a voice clone. This is not a story. This has actually been happening. Look at these news reports. This is already happening in the country. If you've not heard about this or if you have been scammed by something like this using AI, tell us the story in the comments and we'll feature it on 01's Instagram. And the stories don't stop there. I mean, I have one more story and it says a voice deep fake was used to scam a CEO out of $243,000 US dollar about not two lakh rupees 22 lakh dollars. Oh my god. Now the same thing can actually be used in a video call as well. Now this video call could last a few seconds. They do low lighting, bad quality, and a relative or someone you know asks for money and the phone is out. These calls last a few seconds and they say something extreme like they're in trouble, XYZ happened, they urgently need the cash, and in the panic, you don't notice the lip movement, the new phone number, and all these other things. You're just trying to help your friend or your relative. And there are a lot of stories around this, too. Like this employee over here was scammed of $25 million because he got a call from the company CFO. The money was transferred only to find out the video call, although was real, the video itself was deep fake. I'm going to tell you a very simple way to figure out whether something is real or not. So look at this video very carefully and tell me whether it's real or fake. You can't be pro- insurrection and pro cop. You can't be pro- insurrection and pro-democracy. You can't be pro- insurrection and pro-American. Now, as you can see, this is obviously fake. I mean, you could tell, right? So, pause the video, write in the comments. Yes, I think it's fake. Write it. That's Joe Biden. He doesn't He doesn't talk like that. Look at his eyes. They were not blinking. Fooled you. That was actually real. This was a real video. And because he wasn't blinking, it looked like a deep fake. But this is actually a real video. My point is, we don't know the difference about what's real and what's fake. The lines are getting really blurred and Joe Biden, can you please blink? The fourth problem is false information. And this one is a little scary. This year, January 2024, a lot of people in America got a call from Joe Biden saying, \"Do not vote this election.\" And this call was completely deep faked. Imagine the misuse and misinformation that is spread through this because elections are a really important part of democracy. And this is not just reserved for people in America and Europe. It happened in India too. MKkesh Amani a proper deep fake banana asking people to invest in this new investment opportunity and people lost money in it because they thought MKkesh Amani is actually talking about this but it was a complete deficit. The most interesting thing about humanity is our ability to work in groups and cooperate over really large scales without knowing the other person. Humanity has found a way to do it through systems and processes and through storytelling. And because we believe in those tales, we're able to cooperate and mass and work together. And that is the reason of our progress. So in one word, the reason of our progress is communication. Think about Hitler. He could with a speech and talking move people. [Music] Hitler is thrilled and delighted. [Music] To die for him in wars. The problem with AI is not just the scams. The problem is as Yuval puts it that AI has hacked the being of what makes us human. It has hacked communication. Suddenly the communication is being done by an AI. Who do we really believe? And what if it comes up with its own culture that's better than what we think about? Tell us to do things that maybe aren't good for us, but because the storytelling is so powerful, we actually do it. I think that is a little more scarier than anything else. Which is why before scaring you a little more, let's talk about some solutions and how we can combat this entire problem. So the first most obvious one is that AI created the problem and AI will give us a solution. In fact, we already have some bots right now which you can use to figure out if it's artificially generated or not. Point number two, watch and listen carefully. Look at the lips very carefully. Do they look slightly out of sync? Like I just did right now. That was artificial intelligence. If the lips seem slightly off, there is a good chance that some kind of AI was used to create this. And sometimes the audio is just a little not that clear in a video call that is deep fake. Know the limitations of the tech right now. Having your hands in front of your face and talking is not good for the AI and it doesn't render properly. So, if they can't do this very easily, that could be a red flag. If they can't move their heads around too easily, that could be a red flag. All of these things are red flags, especially if it's coming from an unknown number. Solution number four, if you see a video or a voice clip that just sounds really extreme and is going viral on the internet and everyone is just reacting to it. that the men who went to the moon to explore in peace will stay on the moon to rest in peace. Chances are that may not be real. Give it some time. Someone will figure out whether it is actually fake or not. Don't react in that moment. And obviously just don't share that video. I mean we can all do our bit in not letting it spread further. And finally, number five, report the deep fake or if someone tries to scam you, report that scam. So the cyber crime authorities actually know about it and you should use them by going to this website. Fill this up and tell the authorities about it. The link is in the description and save that link. Who knows when you might need it. If you found this interesting, please let us know what you think about it. And maybe don't share this video. Tell one friend about all of this so all of us know about the scams that could happen to us. and we can be a little more vigilant, a little smarter. If you thought this was good, say something nice in the comments. Don't say something nice. I saw you guys do that last time. Say a few words about it. And see you in the next episode. Experimental video. Huh? [Music] And sometimes the audio also is like little party right Fast.",

    "transcript_full": "[Music] am I even getting paid enough a for the job will I get laid off should I start something of my own will I ever be rich doing this job I'm here to tell you you did well I mean you got good grades in college you studied hard and got yourself a job and it's an okay okay pay also co-workers be but right now you don't like your job in fact you think you're being underappreciated and underpaid and I completely understand this I mean is 9 to5 job actual modern day slavery I mean the salary is not going to make you rich so in this episode we'll talk about whether the 9 to5 job is the right thing or not for you and if you're maximizing your true potential and how do you make all that money in a job is it even possible we'll talk about the good and we'll talk about the bad cuz clearly Pari walas and the internet is not telling us the truth let's [Music] begin now if you look at 9 to5 closely I mean the points are not in favor of you actually doing it so first there are low wages and long working hours I mean who wants to work that long for such a pay then there's job insecurity heard about those layoffs some of you are so skilled you can start your own business and make some money just not ready yet and of course you could have B managers and office politics and not to mention that this job that you're in will not make you rich right I mean look at your salary multiplied by 10 20 years does it really compound into a large number probably not so let's do something let's go one by one starting with long working hours and low wages actually if you look at this pay it's about 2 and2 lakhs a year for fresh graduate they are the future of the country India has to become number one how will India become number one if you're paying them only 2 and a half lakh rupees a year and this number apparently has not been changing for many many years right but before you get on to this rant and say salaries come at the start of your career you will always have lower comparative wages and long working hours these are the years where you actually put in the grind to learn what your job is your salary is not a wealth tool at this point it's just keeping you alive it's paying for your rent paying for a bunch of other stuff just basically introducing you to this Adult World and if you look around the world whether it's America or India your starting salaries are always relatively lower to when you have more experience and that makes sense right but what you need to keep in mind is that your salary will not increase linearly it will increase exponentially over the next 10 years and it has to do with three things one is to do with your own experience as you add age your salary bracket normally increases number two your own skill level and I think this is 99% of the game if you aren't good at your own job and you're not literally the best on the floor you won't make it and third is industry growth if the industrial in is growing like crazy you benefit from those Tailwinds now the first two is completely in your control and you can work on this right now you can pause this video and actually begin make it a habit to improve your own skill and of course stay long enough and your salary will increase but the third thing which is the industry headwinds or the Tailwinds are not in your control you can't worry about this a good example is a software engineer working in a nice startup in this country versus a software engineer working inside open AI on AI because he happened to learn it in college both of them salaries will be completely different this salary is not bad but this salary at open AI is probably a million that's 8 rupees in salary now coming to point number two of course if you have been reading the papers you can see that people get laid off which means experience skill is very nice but still one day you get that email and you've been fired I mean what's the point of all of this if there is no job security and why the hell should you even think about doing a 9 to5 job if one day they'll come to you and say bye-bye it's over okay let's think about this a little bit so a job insecurity layoff situation happens when companies are firing their employees and mass for example there was a crazy edtech boom in India and they were hiring like crazy now that bubble has burst and they are laying off like crazy and you go back in time you will always see the same pattern now you tell me if we all live inside this capitalist Society in India in the world when in Industry doesn't do well do all three of these people get affected and these three people are the employee the founder and upper management and the investor the answer is all three when an industry doesn't do well all three actually get laid off the founder probably loses his company the investor probably Los loses his valuation and his investment and the employee loses his job in most cases like this everyone's affected so whether you are doing a 9 to-5 job you are an investor or whether you started your own company you will be affected the best thing you can do is rely on your experience and skill to figure out what to do next and I think all these three guys will have to do the same thing the third is bad manager or just bad office culture you know this is what an office looks like isn't that beautiful going to the gym in the morning having breakfast going T de T Dum working a little bit then going out playing a game and coming back to work and being paid $100,000 a year your expectations are being set by this highlight reel on the internet I'll tell you a little story when I was in school my mother who was the principal of a school used to come back every day and because she's very expressive she used to tell us everything that happened in office is she used to talk about the bad things she used to talk about the good things she used to talk about what she's worried about she used to tell us is person she felt really bad and as kids our expectations were set that work life is mixed you have great days bad days and most days are boring days and this was the expectation when we started the company also because that's what I was taught but in your case things are different because your expectations are being set by this highlight reel on the internet which is Instagram which only picks the best things because they want views and you think that's what work life is but it's not office culture is not break rooms and offsites and playing and laughing all the time and iced tea chai latte what is chai tea it's none of these things it's your relationship with your work with your managers with your colleagues and every company is different so first stop looking at the internet to find out what your expectations should be of an office I think what you should focus on right now is becoming so good at your work that people around you treat you slightly differently because you're good at your work you need to go work hard learn something and once your ability is at certain level everyone will treat you differently got it but in some cases the office culture and the manager both can be bad I mean if someone is actually exploiting you humiliating you in front of everyone Etc these aren't normal cases these are edge cases and you should find a way to either get it stopped by talking to them or just find a new company but you need to know one thing the manager is probably thinking of 12 other dimensions that you aren't all you're thinking is why isn't he or she appreciating me why am I not paid my due if he a good manager she will definitely tell you what is wrong and make sure that that behavior doesn't happen again if that person says no I won't tell you that's a sign of a bag manager second review this again after 30 days or 20 days and ask for active feedback again a good manager will give you feedback and help you improve now step three if your experience is still bad ask for the upper management to change your team step four if your situation is still bad then switch your job and find something else simple then of course we have Point number four which is your skills have come to a point where you can actually do a freelance or start your own company I mean makes sense right so here's the thing starting a company is not as easy as you think and we have a fair video talking about freelance and starting your own business if you're in a 9 to5 job watch that video to understand and well we'll de influence it for you Point number five your job your salary will obviously never make you rich right I mean 10% increase every year for the next 20 years it's not a lot right well wrong like I said earlier your earnings actually increase exponentially over decades and this is not done every year it comes in spikes every few years when you least expect it when all these three dimensions actually come into a single point where experience your skill and the industry is all growing exactly like it is for the investors and the founder at this point all three are in alignment and they all receive some form of exponential growth and this is completely normal and a good thing in fact if you look at the top CEO salaries it goes into crores actually it goes into tens of cror now I know what you're thinking these are big companies these are really old people of course their salary is like 20 crores but even if you look at startups the cxo team that is minus one to the founder they also have a salary range of 1 to 4 CR rupees now in any case if you understand compounding and investing 1 to 4 CR rupees salary is really good especially if you can compound it over 10 12 15 year period so thinking that your salary can't make you rich is completely false what you don't realize is your probably not there in experience and skill right now but you will be there in the future and when you do the opportunity will present itself and let me tell you a lot of Founders well most Founders don't make 1 to four CR rupees a year in salary they are trying to do a big outcome and it's highly risky another interesting Ray of Hope is sat Adela Indra Nui and so many so many people out there actually started as just normal employees in a company and worked their way up to become CEOs which means again if you have all these three things aligned over a long period of time skill compounds and that compounds to money too I think skill compounds better than money in most cases I'd love to hear your experience and the comments below see you in the next one",

    "title_current": "Biggest UPI SCAMS Exposed",
    "transcript_full": "Indians loved cash until we got lowcost internet and covid 500 rupee and 1,000 rupe currency notes will no longer be legal tender and these two events created a Canon event in India which was UPI in fact four out of every five transactions are done through UPI and while this growth has been really impressive the problem is that so have the frauds 1,750 crores that's how much was lost due to cyber fraud in Just 4 months and this is what was reported to the Cyber cell who knows what it actually was so this is getting a little out of control so in this episode we're going to talk about the good well not really mostly the bad of UPI frauds and how you can prevent it because your next UPI transaction could be a scam so we got to know about this scam when three people actually fell victim to it in our own office so let's talk about scam number one meet and mole he normally doesn't work really hard and is dancing around in the office he loves art and always comes up to people and says hello good morning so one day he was deep in his work when suddenly a message pops up on his phone that was unexpected and before he can figure it out tring tring his phone rings from an unknown number but unmo picks it up h now this feels a bit weird so says a minute let me check sir please return that poor guy seems to be in some sort of medical emergency so as a good human he says I'm sending you back your 11,000 and you enter 11,000 and your pin and the payment is done so let's break down this entire scam first he gets a call from an unknown number and a credit immediately out of nowhere second there is emotional pressure and a time limit to return this money that he supposedly got third he didn't check his bank account to check whether he actually received a credit or not because sometimes that SMS could be faked checking your bank account to see whether you received a credit or not is important because when you look at this SMS it looks like an SMS from your bank that youve received money but look carefully that is not your bank account number which you conveniently ignored and it's not being sent by the actual bank it's sent by a sender a random number they basically copied the format and sent it to you and because people don't notice and there's so much of pressure there's a call there's emotional pressure you send the money if someone says he sent you money check your bank account fourth if you refuse and tell the scammer hey I will not pay you he may threat and say I will Lodge a police complaint and with this fi the police will get involved these scammers are more professional than you think they probably have a database Excel sheets and sop K targets quarterly incentives they're running this like a freaking business anyway let's get to scam number two UPI autopay meet vandit he loves bikes but now drives a car for some reason must be the girlfriend he's working in the office just like a normal day and boom pops up Netflix autopay subscription now he's already enjoying Netflix and every month he has to pay this is an auto deit and he thinks you know what I will just accept it and he clicks on the link and here's how a simple notification that looked so cute so simple to make your life easier turned into a fraud hey guys so we launched two new channels 01 women and 01 Hindi do check that out and now back to the episode so let's break down this entire scam one you get an SMS from Netflix asking you to autopay now there are many people who subscribed to this service and you might think you can there are two things that could happen here you're actually doing an autopay for someone else's Netflix account which means you're paying every single month till the end of time to this person what a cheap fraud but I mean second the people could just change their own name to Netflix or prime or some other popular name thinking you're paying for a service but you're just sending it to a person I know this sounds weird but we found cases where the name of autopay was Amazon but it was going to an individual so you actually should pause the video open it up and see if you have automatic payments running right now also notice anyone can guess your UPI ID it's usually your phone number and at multiple bank account possibilities they can actually send an autopay request for a different service so you got to be careful and here is the third scam unclaimed cashback rewards that you will get in your account immediately meet Rishi this guy makes a lot of noise and does even less work he loves Cho chavel loves rajma but hates to cook it himself anyway one day he was pretending to work and he gets a popup on his phone bring someone says that you have it unclaimed cash back available this is followed immediately by a phone call hello I'm calling from XYZ deput company sir and you have 7,000 cash back remaining that is to be credited to your account but your account is unverified Sir this is a reminder call because this is expiring in the next 2 hours our server resets in the next two hours sir so can I just quickly verify and this amount will be transferred to you Rish she is little shocked little surprised very nice he says yes sir tell me what I need to do to get this verification done sir it's a simple digitalized process all you need to do is to tell me your full name once you are done with this our server will accept it and you shall get your cashback he receives an SMS from the authorized person and it says sir click on the link and verify your UPI ID by entering your PIN once you've done this our servers will accept it and you shall get the cash back and when for the money to come into his account which never does he just got defrauded so let's break down this entire scam now before we talk about the red flags I want you to watch this clip are transferring money from your account clearly the person on the other end is saying enter the UPI pin to receive the money guys you enter the UPI pin to send money there is no functionality to put in the PIN to receive the cash now here's the most important part the checklist one your UPI pin is to send money never to receive or to verify the only case you'll use your PIN is to send cash second if you get an SMS of a credit or a debit verify it on your actual banking app do not blindly believe in just the SMS because as you know it can be faked third if you get a call from an unknown number even if it sounds like someone familiar it could be an AI generated voice giving you a sense of urgency to complete some payment really quickly because someone's in danger always verify whether this is true or not number four don't share your UPI ID publicly people are waiting for that information no one should know this unless they really need to know it number five actually set a daily transaction limit for your UPI it could be useful if something like this does happen to you don't forget to call this number and report it to the cyber crime police if you have faced a UPI scam please tell us the story in the comment if we share with each other we learn also type the influencing Army see you in the next episode",

51% so a single year it could be 100% 80% minus 50% but it averages out to 12% over a decade got it oh okay these are the averages of all the other sectors as well now Nifty 500 TR that's Nifty 500 average is% what do you learn from that that you can't pick an idea or theme and then think I will beat Nifty or the index because it just doesn't work out like that sir but I have a question so I know that this sector is booming right now now it will go up let's say for the next 2 years after 2 years I think I'll make more returns well that's an average of What 10 11 years make sense correct but if you look at this over here 2017 realy was 100% maybe you were thinking that at that time also I know this sector will do well and the next year it fell by- 33% so a simple way to look at this is there is no way to predict what sector will do well there's just no way for you to know basically solution but it's going to be really difficult to do I'll do it you just tell me now I think it's too difficult to do we should move on to the next tell me please okay hey guys so we launched two new channels 01 women and 01 Hindi do check that out and now back to the episode so basically what I was trying to say is you need to enter at the right valuation cycle it can't be too expensive it has to be on the cheaper side that is some you have to do some analysis for that second you have to make sure the earning SE the earning cycle of that sector is at the right it's not at the top like it's still growing and then finally you have to choose the right fund which is Diversified the correct way this is a little tough to do is it possible perhaps but it's really really really really really tough and I I'll show you let's say we look at Auto auto makes sense give me three reasons why Auto is a good investment uh cars Evergreen yes um people want cars every day okay comp too much traffic because people want cars and India has too many cars too many people oh sorry are people because okay so 2018 you decide to invest in this sector the auto index I'm looking at Nifty Auto index 17 now over here basically from 201718 it's about January roughly all the way till what is this 23 May 2023 your fund basically broke even it didn't make any money in fact it fell what 6 years it fell 62% maximum in between these years then recovered and it was Break Even after that so the cost of Mis timing is just losing 6 years now if I look at the same portion 2018 to this may 2023 nift let's see what it looked like I actually don't know what this answer is going to be obviously sir you know um over here roughly May 2019 all the way to 2023 um you actually yeah the markets quite up did it fall like Auto yes they both fell but because Nifty is the average of all these companies it actually performed better than Auto H now can you also pick the best performing sector by mistake yes you can but do you want to take that risk no right after this the cost of mistiming is very high buta you still feel really strong for one sector you can invest maybe 4 or 5% of your total portfolio in a sector maybe because you think it's interesting this is not advised by the way you should have an adviser helping you out so will you invest in thematic or sector funds I don't know okay actually the internet will confuse you so over here we have a a a headline which says explosive growth of Defense sector become darling of investors it's 100% gain so much money has been invested by government you'll feel a little foro right sector correct am not yeah you'll feel that the sector is doing really well M now at this time what will happen is that mutual funds will start releasing nfos or new fund offers new mutual funds around this new sector sector and that's their job but you will feel the fo and feel like investing in that thematic idea or that sector oh because I have because the sector is trending right now everyone is talk but you don't want to invest in a trend you want to create long-term longterm wealth yes correct correct so don't let that happen and there's another question also I have for you let's say you invested in say Nifty energy how many stocks do you think you've actually invested in P okay we don't know how many stocks because it changes from every sector it changes from every sector but what if I told you the top 10 stocks in every sector represent Almost 100% of that fund exposure so it's limiting your diversification and of course in this Buy and Hold doesn't work because some ideas some sectors are so cyclical that they may not work an alternate to this is that you become so good at fundamental analysis and investing that you can pick stocks yourself but until then you should do this sir tell me or everyone about the Fest the Fest the Fest I can't tell you right now but Instagram will tell you and the comment section we can drop a few Clues and see you in the next episode [Music]",

    "transcript_full": "One phone call. Hello. One victim. One crime. And five lakh rupees gone from her account. Are you going to transfer Rs 5 Lakh. Yes or no? These scammers target people in tier one and tier two cities. But the question is this. How can someone on a phone call tell something to a victim to make them pay lakhs of rupees? And this is happening every day. Do you really think that a CBI officer or a supreme court judge will ask for a bribe? Right, okay, sir! I am sorry. This is a serious case of money laundering. They say things you won't even imagine to an intelligent public just like you. So we recreated an entire call. Created a list of red flags and a checklist you can share with your family. Listen carefully. Hello. This is an automated call from FedEx. Your courier has been restrained at the Delhi airport. For more information, press 1. To repeat. Hello, this is Rakesh Kumar from FedEx Courier Service. How may I help you? Hello sir, I just got a call from someone saying that my courier has stopped at Delhi airport. Please can you check? I didn't order anything. Err, one moment ma'am, I'll check the orders under your mobile number. Ma'am, as far as I can see, your courier hasn't arrived yet, you have sent a courier from Delhi to Taiwan. Huh? No, I haven't sent anyone a courier, it's a mistake from your end. Err, look ma'am, half of your number was verified in this courier, but in your luggage, the Delhi police found two fake passports and MDMA. MDMA? What are you saying? That's the issue ma'am, that's why you got this call. You must be aware that it's an illegal drug. What are you saying? Where will I get MDMA from? I don't even know anyone in Taiwan. Ma'am, one moment, 7033 **** 2042, this is your Aadhaar number, right? Hello? Hello ma'am, are you? Who gave this to you? Is this a joke? Ma'am, listen to me. Sir, I don't know anyone in Taiwan, nor have I sent a courier. I live in Mumbai. Ma'am, please listen to me. I understand what the problem is. Maybe your Aadhaar number has been leaked and someone has illegally… Yes, so please cancel the order. It's not mine. Ma'am, please understand one thing. It's an illegal drug case. Please file a complaint with the Delhi Police. But why should I talk? I don't want to get involved. You do it. Ma'am, your Aadhaar number is linked to this. It will be a problem for you. There will be an FIR. Your passport will be blacklisted. That's why I am telling you. Okay, what do I have to do? Ma'am, see, the details of your case are already with the Delhi Police. I will transfer your call there. Problem will be solved. Okay, you do the transfer. Yes ma'am. Delhi Police Station. Inspector Manish. Hello. Sir, I just got a call from FedEx. They have actually transferred the call. Meera is using an Aadhaar card illegally. She has sent a courier from Taiwan. I had to file a complaint for that. Okay. Okay, please tell me your name and Aadhaar number. Yes sir, please write. Avneet Singh. Aadhaar is… One second. 7033 **** 2042. 2042, right? Okay, you stay on hold. I will check and let you know. Okay. Hey Sharma, I am sending you the details. See, are you a case waste? Yes sir. One minute, I will tell you now. Sir, this is a big case. Money laundering of 4 crores. Hello sir. And the girl is running the whole gang. What are you saying? Ma'am, what all have you done? Why sir? What happened? Why sir? Should I tell you what happened? First of all, you are running the gang of money laundering and drugs. On top of that, your illegal drugs have been caught. And you are complaining to me. Which drugs sir? I just do a job in Mumbai. There is no gang. I just came to complain. I didn't do anything. Don't act too much. I know everything. Wait, I will take you on video call. Then I will tell you what all you have done. Sir, please listen to me. Hey, shut up. I am doing video call right now. And son, if you don't answer the call, then see. But sir, why video call? Because you are a digital arrest now. Answer the call quickly. Yes, listen to me carefully. During this call, you will neither call anyone nor talk to anyone. Understood? And tell me one thing. Who all are there in the house? Sir, I live alone in Mumbai in a flat. And what does the family do? Sir, mom lives at home and dad does farming. There are only three people. Okay, do one thing. Turn on the rear camera. And show me the entire room. And there should be no one in the room during the entire investigation. Okay. No sir, there is no one. You can see. Stop, stop, stop. Close this door. And put the curtains too. Listen again. The call should not be switched off. Otherwise, the next bell will ring at your house. Mumbai police. Understood? But... Now put the phone on flight mode. But sir, why video call? Don't you have Wi-Fi at home? Don't do drama. But sir, why are you doing this to me? I just came to complain. You are blaming me. I have not done anything. You check my bank statement. Please ask your family. Okay, I will ask my family. Do they know about the late night party? Do they know that you smoke? Should I tell them? No sir. Please. No, no, tell me. Sir, I don't want to go back to the village. I will lose my job. Please. Why are you doing this? Why? Why shouldn't I tell? You are innocent. Sir, I have not done anything. I just came to complain. Please don't do this. Please. We are collecting more information about you. Okay? Till then you stay on this call. Okay? I am putting you on hold. And you won't move from this call. You have to say something every 10 seconds. And what do you have to say? I am here. What do you have to say? I am here. Say it again. You should listen. I am here. Okay. I am putting you on hold. Don't go anywhere. And if you go anywhere, I will understand that you are contacting someone. Okay? Then this will become a case. Got it? I am putting you on hold. Don't move from here. Okay. I am here. I am here. I'm here. See. All the evidences are against you. Okay? The arrest warrant is going to be issued now. Mumbai police is going to come to your house. Okay? The news will be published in the morning. No. No, sir. Please. I am innocent too. Please. Trust me. Please help me. Avneet ji. It is too late for help. Think of something. If something can be done. Sir. I can send you 5-10,000 rupees. Please. Don't do this anymore. 5-10,000 rupees? For such a big case? It will cost 5 lakh rupees. Sir. 5 lakh rupees is too much. One rupee won't be less than 5 lakh rupees. Sir. I don't have that much. Please. r. Everything will be done. Do it. Sir. But. Will you do 5 lakh rupees or not? Sir. But. Yes or no? Sir. Listen to me. Yes or no? So do you think Avneet actually paid the money? These are three reasons why Avneet will actually pay the money. One, she got a call from an authoritative figure. In this case it was FedEx. It could also be a fake TRAI, a fake CBI and the list can go on. Second, they convince you that your details have been misused and it's not your fault. And you must find a way to get out because you are actually innocent. Third reason, they will fake government IDs, papers and a bunch of things to actually prove that this is coming from a legitimate source. Because you are scared and there's a time limit, you end up paying. There's a checklist in the description. Check it out and share with someone who needs it.",

    "title_current": "Your first international trip under ₹50,000",
    "transcript_full": "This is my passport and I've been to some 20 plus countries in my life and Swati and I have actually made it a priority but people in the office want to start traveling and they gave us a challenge. They said Pratik can you help us travel to Thailand and the budget is under one lakh. I said no I can do it in under 50,000 rupees. I actually have this hackbook which includes stay, travel, experience and all other costs. So let's start with the first hack that's traveling. You can actually go to an aggregator. I'm going to use Google flights. You can use some other aggregator if you like. So what I can do is I can pick Bangalore, Phuket and not put a departure and return and just hit search. Once I do this I can see all the flights for December, there's November, there's January and then there's February. These aggregator websites sometimes tell you in green which is the cheapest. So I know over here that January cheapest is 18,000 19,000 and February cheapest is 17,000. So that's cool. So what I'll do is I will assume it's 18,000. I'll pick a slightly higher number. So I'll put this. We thought it's 30,000 but now it's 18k because we did a little bit of snooping and yep this is the cost. Next is the visa cost. And up to 60 days there is no cost of the visa. So I'm going to enter zero over here. So estimated price is zero and hacked price is zero as well. Now to keep this explanation simple, I have selected Thailand. So the variables will change if you want to do Bali or Vietnam or some other country. But let's stick to Thailand as an example. The people in office over here want to go to Thailand. I wonder why. So the next thing is actually local travel. This is actually really interesting. So I remember going to Thailand. This is true for Vietnam as well. If you take a local taxi, they actually don't go by the meter. They say, >> \"Oh, 150.\" >> 150. No, no, no. >> 100. >> No, no, no, no, no. Dear me, >> oh, sorry, sorry, >> sorry. No, me >> 100. >> No. >> And then they will charge something that they feel is fair. And this is usually unfair, especially for tourists. The actual good way is to use Wajaka Uber, which is Grab. Check this out over here. A journey on Grab is 146 Thaiba. However, if I took the local train, the same trip costs 47 Thaibath. So when we first did this we were so smarty pants that we just used the train and then after 3 days after 3 days the hotel reception person says sir you could have just got this train pass thing for 150 bath and traveled unlimited anyway you don't do what young Pratik did and get that pass it's even more economical so now I'm going to put this on the excel sheet eat and I'll add local travel and I'll put 5,000 as estimated price and 3,600 as the hack price because we intelligent. But you know the problem over here is that we've already spent 21,000 rupees and our total budget is 50k to how will this happen? I'll tell you it's actually learning to be a traveler not a tourist. So when you go to a place like Vieter or Trip Adviser and you click on experiences, they will show you a bunch of things you should you must do in Thailand, most of this is wrong touristy stuff, overcrowded and not fun. And here's what that normal itinerary will look like. Floating market party at this Bangla road place, very fun. Ziplining an ATV at Chiang Mai. Now, if this is your jam, you should definitely do it. But we're going to Thailand for the third fourth time. This is what I'm going to do 10th of December onwards. I wanted to try this Buddhist monk chat. I'm not kidding. So there's this actual um temple where they're real Buddhists and I think during the entire day you can walk in anytime and you find a monk sit with them and you can just talk. There's another place called Bang Watt. I'm not sure how to pronounce it, but it's an artist village artist and they have paintings and pottery and different things. Now, you can go there and buy stuff, but that entire lane also has places where you can sit and actually do pottery. Then there's a bamboo rafting at Muang River. Again, a lot of people don't do this, but you go through this beautiful river on a bamboo, and it's simply quiet. Then there's this amazing sunrise at this mountain I cannot pronounce. And this night paddle boat at the beach. Point is very simple. Something that's overcrowded and overdone and probably not that fun is costing 16,500. And a bunch of experiences I showed you that I'll probably do cost 13,000. Cheaper and double the number of experiences. And I can guarantee the experience itself is also deep and good. So now that you know how to find these hidden gems, let's talk about how you can actually save money starting with food. If you go to Singapore to have chili crab, we went to a nice fancy restaurant. It was super expensive. I think we paid 10K for the crab. I think if we paid 10,000 for a single crab, it was amazing. But people told me chili crab is available anywhere. It'll be 1/4 the price and probably tastier. We made that mistake. So when you go to Thailand, don't do that. Don't go to a fancy restaurant. Find a nice local restaurant with great reviews. Stand in line and enjoy the food. It's not only cheaper, it's probably a 10x better experience. So, the next hack is shopping. Basically, I have a Swati, my wife. She told me this. While she was doing this shopping, I was standing outside and then I saw her take the card out. So, I walked up to her and as she's swiping the card options on the point of sale machine and the first option was pay in local currency and the second option was pay in. I thought bat man you should pay in INR and she selected the local currency and it happened. I said why did you do that? Basically there is a dynamic currency conversion that happens when you swipe your card which basically means when you select INR that conversion happens for no reason and you pay charges when you're in a foreign country always choose pay in the local currency to save that markup. In fact, I have this chart over here for you to see the actual cost from all these banks. Do you notice something new here? Forex card. A forex card is basically a prepaid card that you can get loaded in India with USD, euro, in this case the thibbath. And once you go there, you actually save from that conversion of that currency. So over here I'll add shopping. I'll put zero which is not real. So instead of 10,000 I'll put 6,500 because you'll save on all these things. And next we have is attractions. We've already covered it. So instead of 5,000 I'll put 4,000. Next is this the SIM card. SIM card has a very simple fun. If you buy it in India it's going to cost and be expensive. If you buy a SIM card at the airport it's even more expensive. What's actually kiti and cheaper is to go to that country and buy it at a local shop. So I'll add 1,100 rupees to the Excel sheet. If you thought these hacks so far were amazing, wait till you hear the golden hack. But before I tell you the golden hack, I want to tell you something else. And the hack is to spend money on your desires. Like in Finland, we saw the northern lights. It was expensive, but it was beautiful. And it was freezing cold. It was what, 11:00 p.m. at night, and we were out till 2:00 a.m. When we came back to our room, the room has this bed facing the sky, and there's this oval um shield of glass that looks out and then Swati touches the bed and she's out. But for some reason, I was feeling so thankful. Wow. There was a single meteor I think which went from one end of the sky to the other end and it was the most beautiful thing I've ever seen. I think when you go on these experiences you will find experiences not on your Excel sheet because that's just what traveling does to you. So I'm going to put 5,000 rupees over here which is more than the estimated price because you deserve to have these experiences. So these are the kind of things that you can't see on your Excel sheet but your life will completely change. But now it's time for the golden hack. So if you travel in any country in the peak season, everything is obviously expensive. Find out Thailand peak season and you have to go in the shoulder season or the slightly off season. Peak season is November to Jan to Feb. Everyone is going there towards the end of the year because of the year. So, it becomes expensive. And I want to show this to you. If you choose a threestar hotel in Bangkok, it'll cost 2,000 to 4,000 rupees per night in a hotel. But what if you didn't do the hotel? What if you did an Airbnb for example? An Airbnb would cost you way less. Like over here, we can see 1,600 for a night. There's also 15,000 rupee option, but you can find the 1,600 one that you see over here. You could also pick these host. If we select a hostel, the dom beds over here cost between 800 to 2,000 rupees a night. You can pick something that looks good. Check the reviews. It'll be cheaper. And I think interesting if you're young, right? You'll meet new people from different countries. They will give you special routes to take. They'll tell you where to go and eat cuz they're optimized for costs. So, everyone in the hostel is helping you how to make your experiences better. So staying in the hostel is cheaper but knowing the roots, the bars, the drinks, the discounts, they will exactly know. So that experience can be really really cool for you. This is something you should definitely try sometime in your life. So on average a hostel will cost you a,000 rupees a night. So if you think that's not a good option, you want to try something else, you can actually try volunteering, which means you can go to this website like World Packers and work away. You can offer your energy or your services in exchange for free stays at hotels or host. So this is something you could also explore. So let's see what our final number is. If I calculate and put hotel from 30,000 to 6,500, the entire cost of the trip becomes, drum roll, I need claps if we did it. 50,700 rupees. YES. MAY YOU HAVE more money in the future to spend more and live life of luxury. I hope you found this useful.",

    "transcript_full": "sit down sit down don't be too excited you can now be rich just like me at a tender age of 16 I bought BMW car impressed you too can get all of these magnificent things what do you want Ferrari no problem right here want Bangla with heated swimming pool no issue Europe trips every single month or anywhere you want you can do the only thing I request from you guys is Dream Big and of course you have to make sure that passive income is now in your hand so for that I have this the starter kit make sure you give this to your friends your family everyone so they too can be recruited now I know network marketing can make you feel like a Cory and why shouldn't it I mean look at all those people who made all that money but you know we should explore how this actually works you know in true de influencing style we'll explore what network marketing is how it works and the goods and the bads because these guys won't tell you the bads but before we start hit that like And subscribe I'm not going to tell you how to become a Cora just like that am I so let's start with step number [Music] one now let's suppose you join a network marketing company you're first required to buy an initial stter kit now this stter kit is actually the product itself say were 20,000 or 50,000 Rupees and this is called the initial investment in the business remember you are not selling you're the owner of your own business passive income and the dream of being fre the next thing I need to do is Recruit new business ass all I need to do is tap my network I will talk to my uncle cha T bua and say earn some money simply become a distributor under me and they will buy that starter kit again through me and now I have six people who are Distributors who are mapped under my name now the beauty is they will go do the same thing tap their own networks and now I have this beautiful pyramid every time they sell a starter kit to start a business for someone else I get a 10% commission and as we go forward I can actually party in Europe because now my Distributors are getting more Distributors who are getting more Distributors who are getting more Distributors you get the point as you can see the benefits are simple there is no R&D in the product the company's already done it for you I just have to be my own boss and enjoy my life because once I've recruited my initial people I can make money third There is almost negligible investment cost imagine if I have to start my own business it'll be tens of lacks of rupees this is is just few tens of thousands of rupees easy I can work from home hell I can work from anywhere I want because my Distributors are doing all the work and finally I'm using my network everyone has a network you have family you have friends you have acquaintances and if you're a really good Hustler you can stop people in the mall and say hey don't eat that ice cream start this business instead the beauty of the business here is and I'm only telling you no one else is that we're not really selling a product we're selling a dream and in the influencer style I think it's time to look at the maths behind this entire business and see how it actually works what are the facts so let's understand the math behind the network so I recruit six people so this is level one those six people recruit six people again that's level two I have a interesting pyramid over here and we can see for each level the number grows so level one is six People level two is 36 level three is 216 level four is 1,296 all the way to level 13 is 13 billion people that's only 13 levels away and fun fact world population is some 8 billion so technically this scheme can't actually work also notice level 1 2 3 might make a lot of money but chances are when you buy that starter kit and you hear all those testimonials you hear people who've made money you're probably level 12 or 13 you're unlikely to make money from it because you're just in too late and you're not the businessman over here maybe you are the customer they say right isy toy and the last person who has a topy who can't push it anywhere else realizes things messed up a little bit this is one problem over here another problem is that you're actually spending time and energy on that dream recruiting people spending on different starter kits traveling making expenses and most importantly not making money initially and because of that you don't realize who the actual customer is think about it if everyone in the scheme is a distributor or a seller who's actually consuming it think about a normal affiliate marketing or referral marketing where you take a referral code tell your friend about it or recruit him and he uses the product here the loop was closed your friend actually used the product I remember telling my friend to use an Uber code but he actually took the Uber trip so he was a consumer I used an online Drive service called Dropbox where I shared a coupon with my friend and he got one TV extra but he used Dropbox as a service now the beauty here is that when a person is consuming that product that business is fine but if everyone's a seller something ain't right a network marketing company could be a pyramid for the features I just explained and in any pyramid scheme 95 to 99% of recruits actually lose money because it's too late and there was an actual study on this in fact in India pyramid schemes are completely banned and in the pyramid scheme you'll see people at the top very small number of them make a lot of money the guys who started it everyone else actually loses money now I'm not saying all network marketing companies are fraud of course not some of them could be and some of them may be disguised but are actually pyramid schemes so here are some features the first feature is that the products claim to do something unimaginable lifechanging that has never happened before they may also say some nutritional products something that may change your height something that can remove covid etc etc these are called tall claims tall claims that no other product can solve except this one there're also more expensive and these guys are super aggressive they want you to become Distributors and sell their product to their friends because this opportunity will never come again they use testimonials as a way to motivate you they'll tell everyone and you that XYZ person and XYZ person has made so much money because he worked really hard and this is the true route to entrepreneurship get a product motivate yourself hustle and get to the top some of these companies Don't Give A certification on their products now many good companies let's look at fmcg companies like Hindustan unever and Colgate Etc have valid certification and are amazing companies but these multi-level marketing companies may not have a certification on their product and that's just not a good thing that's just one of the red flags here and finally there is no end consumer they may say a lot of people have lost weight or increase their height etc etc but the problem is everyone is being sold a pack who is actually buying this actively without talking to a recruiter are people actually buying it off of stores online on legitimate places other ways that this is sold or is it just through a network usually just through a network could be a red flag and you should dig a Little Deeper on how their business model works so the Distributors that you recruited are the customers look at these photos of people all of this in their drawing room because they thought they'll sell it to someone but maybe they were lost in line and they were the customers now they just have inventory and all that commission went above them and they can't do anything about it so if you look at any normal business there is production from the manufacturing unit then there's a distributor who actually gives it to people and sells it and then there's the customer now this is how any business works but in an MLM the distributor is removed and the customer and distributor become one that is the problem now they'll tell you stories to make it not look like this it's your job to figure out where whether it is this or not the question is here that if this is such a great business model why didn't Amani tatas and beras actually use this why do they use the traditional [Music] model maybe because this isn't a model at all but the bigger problem is who they actually Target they target Housewives college students people who are unemployed people who want to prove to the world I want to be entrepreneur people who want to prove to the world that they are worth something and this is exactly what they pray on they tell you the story to make you feel like you're a king ver ran and you're going to become the king/ queen very very soon all you need to do is Step 1 2 3 and buy the star tiet but just when we thought that videos like this will help people de influence this the problem became worse with the internet and Instagram and Telegram and more people who want to prove stuff online and we can't track it this entire process now happens online you follow for example an Instagram page Hustlers trying to tell you how to make that money buy that car get the gold jewelry yeah baby let's do it second step they'll ask you to join a telegram group of exclusive access to the paths to riches now this group # Hustlers will tell you what to do next you'll attend webinars they'll educate you on how to become a businessman and how Financial Freedom is the future and how everyone doing a job is a total idiot step number three you'll join with a starter kit and start recruiting people these channels are crazy motivational they don't talk much about the business but what will happen after it they're selling the dream and look at these screenshots people joining you being pushed to join and you're not paying them remember you're starting a business so any amount just Fails Like a small amount to start a business a couple of 10,000 rupes doesn't seem a lot if you're building your career for it now connecting other people becomes easier because the mode of recruitment is also online next time you see this now you know what to look for and maybe you should talk to your cousin who's in college maybe he knows about this have you ever been pitched an MLM scheme put it in the comments below I'd love to know your story write something detailed because we hear every single comment you write and discuss it right here in the office I'd love to know your story it might help someone",

    "transcript_full": "no [Music] Go sir come here I'm busy right come here AB sir the world is conspiring against me what happened these people are behind my money they are behind my stocks dude such people man I took this trade I put my stop loss then these guys pushed the market down I lost my money and then these guys made the market go up wait wa wait hold on hold on stoploss Hunting has it ever happened you place a stop loss it gets hit and Market reverses or you want to buy a company and then the market goes up doesn't it seem like everyone's conspiring against you and they probably are but there's a simple solution we'll solve for abishek and for you let's get [Music] started so the solution is very simple sir I'll give you the solution okay mental stoploss you are the mental boy now bro no no understand this wait now if I don't tell these guys where my stop- loss is they won't come to know okay and I'll be rich dude so tell me what would you have done during Co remember Co huh the world was falling apart you could not leave there was a lockdown we didn't have a vaccine the market was crashing if you can see if you had a mental stop- loss here and the market fell here when you're trading isn't that really risky what would you do let's suppose you were trading a Futures position okay or let's suppose you had sold options or let's suppose you had done an intraday trade with a lot of Leverage now if this event had happened what would you do with your mental stop like Co what would you do with your mental stoploss you would have lost a large portion of your Capital right you would have lost a large portion of your Capital right this is called a Black Swan event and Black Swan events happen actually pretty often if you look at a 10-e timeline so imagine you trade for a long time and one trade you ruin everything but that's very rare no these events I can make money in but why do you want to lose money in one single event are you comfortable doing that losing all of your Capital because you don't actually have a stop-loss in place and there's another thing most Traders actually have a mental stop- loss so good job but actually bad job because people wait for the market to come near the stop loss and then they modify the order and then they cancel the orders and then they say I think the market will reverse and the market keeps going down so many Traders don't really have a stop- loss in place it's just a mental stop loss but in that case I have to watch the screen now if you're stop loss in place you don't have to do anything you just leave it if it gets hit you're out so having a stop loss is good okay also how productive do you think you've been in office I was looking at your reports your K are not met you're coming late you know why why because you're looking at the screen all day because you don't have a stop loss in place can you really sit in front of the screen all day no what I'll have to do for his productivity see for a stop-loss once you have it you can stay away from the screen but the mental stop L will'll be glued to it Market should I place should I exit what should I do but sir what should I do how can I avoid these Hunters they're hunting my stop loss who are these people dude there is no one after you you know a lot of people think like you they think I'll place a mental stop- loss and I'm talking about retail Traders here I'll place a mental stop loss when markets come closer then I'll get scared then I'll modify I'll cancel I'll edit I'll make the stop loss lower and basically no one really has a stop- loss so there is no day to hunt your stop- loss because most retail Traders don't actually place a stop loss oh no sir I don't agree these people are hunting my money look look there's no them and there's no you the market is many people but but let me let me try to explain maybe you don't understand three concepts and they're all under something called freak trades freak trades okay let me explain what it is a freak trade is when the market goes up and down really fast and you couldn't predict it that's why it's called a freak trade okay and the production team had l work so we asked them to do this this was not planned at all sir fre trade let's start with liquidity okay so let's suppose these are the shares wait this is the shares forget about the color these are the shares of a certain company okay now I want you to take this okay this is one okay 50 car note uh 50 coin let's imagine these are many many shares I want you to throw this in perfect can you tell me where your your coin your share has gone sir what this is not a magic trick the point is if there are many many shares and you put in one share your the liquidity is so much you cannot affect the market do you think that one coin affected with a market of say 50 CR shares that's like a big company that's like a big company it's like a Reliance or an HDFC Bank you can't move the market but let's suppose this is a company hypothetically it has only one share it may have more but let's say it's one share and you have one share and you do a buy or sell can you throw it in it's movable can you tell me which one that's it you affected this small company because the liquidity is less this is the basic funa a small company can be manipulated and a large company is not affected very tough with buy and sell very tough so a small company can have a freak trade but okay take but why are you telling me this how is that related to my problem I looked at the chart you were showing me just there and it seems like the volume is so low that anyone can actually push the market a lot not on purpose but it can happen and because of that you're seeing erratic movements of up and down and your stop loss gets hit so maybe you should stay away from like low liquid stocks oh the second thing of free trades is news news yeah like rumors not rumors oh General news about the company is General stuff right so let's suppose no you won't play Jenga but let's think about uh an indust okay so we have the telecommunication industry India is a land of billions of people many people want to communicate they will pay for this service they will pay for hello tunes and other other value added Services people want the internet as well people also want apps connected to the internet which they use it's a huge market and lot of people are making money from telecommunications then one business comes and says I will make Telecom free so this one person comes and and makes this one change makes the Tariff free and it changes the entire industry now could you have predicted this no because okay his his plan and could have anyone predicted this I don't think so except for him think about old companies like um say Nokia or Xerox or companies you on Kodak you don't hear about these companies anymore C because the business changed so if you don't have control over that when those events happen a freak trade or a really quick move can happen in the short term right and it'll affect a stock Trader huh Trader so there's no them it's just Market forces and the third reason for a free trade is a fat finger error fat what fat finger error wait wait let me explain so imagine you're a Trader working in this really large company and you have to place an order yeah a quantity order we have three decimal places here start writing here put in 10,000 quantity your time is over now I said 10,000 you put in 1 lakh because you didn't give me this is called a fat finger error people type an extra zero so 2,500 may become 25,000 and because of this the market actually moves now luckily India has safeguards against such a thing in 2021 we had a rule that come out that prevents a certain quantity from being accepted by The Exchange it's called a quantity freeze and if uh The Exchange receives a large order of a certain kind right over here it basically Rejects and cancels that order so okay I understood free trades but no one's after me so no girls no Shad people no liquidity issues no one's coming out for you no no one's after you time time and speaking of time there is something called time frame analysis smooth as butter but I need a chart chart chart Halo This is called a time frame effect I want you to look at Red candle this chart H isn't that a crazy fall huh look at this normal markets there's a gap up huge fall but do you think this is a huge freak trade oh that's a very huge freak trade that's a huge freak trade right I want you to notice that this is a 5 minute chart okay this candle is how many minutes 5 minute correct now look at this the same day 28 it's a it's a green candle this is the same day that you just saw so look at this boom Oh my God Market's going to fall selling but actually this is where theet it was it was a normal day right in a smaller time frame it may seem like something crazy is happening it may seem like the market is moving freakishly like a freak trade but if you zoom out or go to a higher time frame like a daily you'll see everything's fine it's normal if you go to a weekly chart it'll be even smoother if you go to monthly it'll be even smoother but I don't trade on monthly chart now so when you're looking at a really low time frame don't think every candle is a freak threade okay good but dude why do you always show me your lost trades like what about your profit Trad oh so you check this trade that's a good profit of course you see the support line right I put up some Fibonacci bja wja bands and it was indicating me to buy the stock and I bought the stock and I made money you're a good Trader of course I come come come here come here okay you know this is actually an interesting human bias so when you're actually making money you feel I've done an amazing analysis I did XYZ and of course I made some money but when you lose then you go into sir sir sir sir sir sir sir and this bias actually means that you feel you cannot do anything wrong when things go right so this bias means that when things go right you don't find a reason of why they went right it was you you are the best person you are great at this and you're a good Trader of course but when things go wrong they may be shadowy people sitting in a Smoke Filled Room sabotaging your trades the economy moved and you had bad luck the news just came out at the wrong time the company changed its business plan etc etc etc the truth is all that is not in your control the only thing really in your control is the stop- loss you can actually place the stop- loss measure your risk do this over a really long period of time make money and you would be fine now you tell me in the comments when was the last time you blamed some crazy thing on a bad trade you did tell me the details on what stock it was how you felt and maybe that reasoning is absurd abishek will feel better you know what will make me feel better when these guys you will subscribe to this channel subscribe now bye come to know where is the price sorry where is the stop loss btss nobody's after me and iuni money in the bank cing and when things don't go wrong and [Music] [Laughter] when",

    "title_current": "What you didn’t know about IPOs 2024 | The Perspective (EP-2)",
    "transcript_full": "since the 1970s companies have raised over $20 trillion from IPOs and it's made some of the most iconic companies and these sconi entrepreneurs into Larger than Life billionaires but behind the hype and the sheen ipus have forever remained a mystery to the arm jenta especially in the age of startups but of course we have some exceptions for example take a look at this St since its listing it's given investors a return of 500% with its price increasing over five times since its listing price now compare this with these three stocks which got listed about 2 years ago and all three have lost over half of their value and investors losing 1.4 lakh crores now deart used the money raise from the IPO to actually grow its business but that's not what's happening with the new age IPOs in fact a lot of these guys are getting an exit the founders and the existing investors and that's called an offs LS what's upit y Dude tell me what the hell is an [Music] [Applause] [Music] office [Music] there are two sellers here one is the company itself who issues new shares and gives it to you the other is the existing promoter wec blah blah blah who are giving their existing shares to you now when the company Issues new shares and sell it to you you're buying from the company and the company gets the money right not the promoters not the v no company has the money right so company spends it on important things like marketing like scaling like going overseas and starting a new business hiring more people growing the actual business actual business setting up more factories producing more stuff advertising more Stuff Etc ET ET right and if it's the L which is the promoter VC investor Etc when they are selling you get their shares and they get your money the second version that is called offs uh offer for sale but dude you know the problem with an offs is not that an offs is wrong the problem is what percentage of an offering in an APO is an offs so if you're raising say 100 CR and the offs is 10 cror it's probably acceptable right because maybe the people have invested for a long time fight it's legit that they get some exit correct but if the entire IPO is an offs and nothing's going to the company that means there is a problem right like they could not raise from private investors or there is no alignment from The Operators of the company to actually grow the business I think a good example is infosis okay go on infosis basically when they listed it to there was no buyers let's forget about that they actually listed at a discount okay uh but the entire or a large part of the money went to infosis with the vision that they will grow the business 100x of course they grow the business many more X from there and when an IPO happens it's an entry for the retail investor it's say day Zero it cannot be the operator's Day end but over the last few years offs has become a common part of companies going public for example in in 2021 of the 1.2 lakh CR rupees 61,000 was an offer for sale which indicates that IPOs were mainly an exit vehicle for their earlier investors but while the early stage investors have earned good Returns the am janta or the retail investor has suffered and this brings up the question are IPOs just an exit vehicle for an early stage investor now actually I think the problem is right the private markets are so extended now there a b CD 10 yeah there's no way as a retailer you're going to get to par think good stuff good stuff won't come to you but then what is the concept of IPOs and history is that can I get something to drink maybe like where did all of this really start from like where did where did IPOs and all start from what's the history in the 1600s imagine 10,000 ships would travel from Amsterdam all over the world to get spices now that was was a hot commodity back in the day you know just like we have oil and data today these ships were owned by the Dutch East India Company now this was a risky business maybe about 6 out of 10 ships would actually sink and since the risk was great the wealthy merchants which owned the company said greetings Rich ass Merchants I think we should not take all the risk I propose giving a small portion of the ownership of the business to the people of Amsterdam but how would we do that simple it's called an IPO it probably didn't happen like that but the Dutch East India issued shares to the public marking the world's first IPO this also established the world's first Stock Exchange the Amsterdam stock exchange the Dutch East India Company eventually went bust in 1799 but before it went bankrupt over 5,000 km away in 1783 the concept of IPOs reached the US Shores with the Bank of North America becoming the first in the US to issue shares to the public soon after the US economy started developing and in 1906 another landmark moment took place in the history of IPOs banking giant Goldman Sachs helped the retail giant seers raised 40 million bucks at that time this was the largest public issue to to help it go public Goldman pioneered what is now known as the price to earnings ratio valuing companies based on their earning potential and Goodwill instead of just the physical asset it owns but what the is a price to earnings ratio let's explain what p ratio is wait uh what's the formula very simply put p ratio tells you how much am I paying for how much so basically you take a share you take the earnings from that share like sh right like how much did I earn from that one share right basically you take the company's entire earnings and then you divide by the number of share that is one share earning rate now to get that much earning how much price did I pay for that share so you take the price of the share P divided by earnings per share e that is p by E ratio that is how much value this thing is giving me because you know how many times are you paying today in terms of the price of the share multiplied by the current earnings same basically how much am I paying for getting this much money correct correct correct it's like saying there is this shop and the shop is doubling in earnings every year though it's okay if I pay two times its current earning because I'm an investor it double b or a business is making 10 Rupees every month yeah you are paying let's say 120 rupees for the business so you know that you know in 12 months I'll recover the price correct roughly of course there's time value of money and all but roughly so if if the P by ratio is very high it means that you're paying a lot of price Goldman Sachs really use the p ratio to raise a lot of money for many companies but a different story was happening in India the tatas were busy scripting India's first IPO so the tatas needed money to set up the steel plant in jamshedpur and they got rejected with all the bankers in London no we shall not give you money for your Pro so the tatas did something unique they went to the Indian public and they raised a cool 2.3 cres you would think after Tata Steel's IPO something would have changed but it wasn't until 1977 that diru bayani's Reliance went public he raised money from 58,000 people kickstarting the equity cult in the country this is the largest investment ever made on the modation of textile unit in the country back then the markets were controlled by the competition Commission of India so companies had to offer shares as low as rupees 10 and the result was an IPO Euphoria between 1980 and 1990 the BC sensex shot up 7 times to 1, 148 points and just when everyone thought things couldn't get much better in 1991 India was liberalized India is on the move again we shall make the future happened Global Brands entered the country bringing more money into the economy and hence the common man's income went up a year later the government introduced new norms and established sebi to regulate the market between this period over 4,000 companies went public a lot of companies which went public at the time were sketchy and soon went bankrupt then came 1997 I mean the party had to fizzle out at some point sebi introduced new listing rules and restricted companies without a proper background from going public but on the other side we had industrial activity which was declining globally and obviously in India but a new chapter was unfolding the internet came to India in 1995 it sparked an it boom in the country helping it become the largest software exporter in the world globally the 90s saw the birth of several internet companies and all of them were going IPO and these greedy investors gave lumps of cash to anyone with a doom in front of it and this came to be known as the dotom bubble this is the growth of VC's investing in the US but in 200000 it hit a new high of $30 billion during the peak of the bubble and post its burst India saw its number of IPOs bounced back but everything can't always be good it all went South soon in 2001 when kaan parik scam came to the Forefront the Katan par scam you know about that right yeah I've heard about that I'm to I I didn't really care about stock markets till I graduated from college to be honest because I was just know I got HED out of college and was put in front of a trading screen I hardly gave two HS about this entire thing trade huh trade yeah yeah yeah that's I was kind of forced into it before that I had zero Kanan par scami I I will oversimplify it basically they were rigging prices of stocks and pushing prices for something like 200 rupees would become 11,000 rupees that's crazy and these are unknown companies basically operator basically operator uh and they would do something called uh what is it called when one person circular trading circular trading right they would do circular trading and push prices up okay now this is basically from what we hear online and this is what the story was okay and SE basically bannned Ken paron okay and this left a any bad taste and this this like the market man there was no trust anymore no one wanted to invest only but then something good happen we had maruti's IPO maruti story is crazy dude like I'm sure you'll agree they own like what 50% market share I think even today they're 45 46% every second car that means the maruti in the country yeah yeah but I think the IPO itself right most of the money went to the business the business actually grew and gave a 5,000% stock return but the business business also grew it's not that the price went up so that was nice maruti was one of India's favorite companies everyone knew the company and it did well in its Market IPO debut and because of this everyone looked at the market and said H and it started a new IPO frenzy we had 277 companies which went public raising 1 lakh crores you know the dlfs the icic banks the reliance petrochemical and State Bank of India were some of the names if you've liked this episode so far don't forget to give a like And subscribe to this channel because we have a lot more programming coming your with AB back to the episode I think at this point I have to ask you a question have you invested in IPO uh I would like to say no but I actually have I invested in the best IPO ever that hit the Indian Shores and dude it was formal man I had rich people around me telling to buy and I had a system by the way back then even on had to trade Etc I was short mini Nifty by the way on pure luck uh I had drawn a trend line and said your trend line to short that was the only reason okay and uh the market fell but as public markets were melting the private Markets started buzzing with activity VCS aggressively started giving money to upand cominging companies also known as startups and as the startups grew vanity metrics go up the VCS look to encash their bets by pushing them towards public markets now among the companies they nudg to go public was the relatively Young Facebook which went public in 2012 raising $16 billion at a $104 billion valuation now many early stage Facebook investors such as Peter thel Goldman Sachs DST made massive gains from the IPO helping Kickstart the phenomena that a VC back startup could go public over the years and make these investors money by 2021 this trend reached Indian Shores thanks to the domestic startup ecosystem maturing Rising per capita income and postco liquidity more importantly there was a tweak in the rule by market regulator sebbi due to the onset of this bull period in 2021 the BC sensex gained over 10,000 points marking another IPO boom with many companies going public raising a record 1.2 lakh CR and it seems like this trend isn't ending and all these IPOs bring us to this question are IPOs just an exit vehicle for early stage investors and should the retail investor stay away from it so here's the thing right I think the psychology is this right I think retail investors participate in IPO so if if you ask me right I don't think there's much of a difference between an IPO and a normal share purchase whether you invested in the IPO of TCS in let's say 20034 whenever it was launched or you bought it like 3 years after uh it was ipoed it's not like your returns would have varied much right or even in IPO right whether you participate in the IPO or picked up in like 3 4 years later I don't know how much of a difference I mean ultimately if you have done 30X 40x instead of that you have done 20x 30X T care right but I think the catch is people don't look at it that way and the of there is something freshly coming in Market which everybody might have missed let me go get some of that I think that's one psychology driving BP's IPO dude I don't know dude last year I feel 2022 most people wanted to flip the IPO they would buy it to sell on listing day if you come with that mindset I think the people who lost one the IPO you deserve it man yeah but but then that's the thing right I think stock markets in general regardless of whether it's IPO or not people should have like a 20 30 year mentality this entire thing of I and flip it next month see the thing is this right you might be able to do it in one IPO you might know five friends who flipped two IPOs now the catch is this right you said there were 3,000 IPOs but when we were backstage and we were discussing we had to find some good IPOs we really had to think right now no that this is the reality right there 3,000 IPOs and we had to Google search okay which one's did well and you came up with some five to 10 days what people don't talk about what is unsung what people don't know about is the remaining 2900 IPOs which went nowhere yeah right and that's the catch people just hear about the success story it's exactly like you know whether I should be a cricketer or not you can't decide to be a cricketer based on you know Ki did well look at how rich how good a life he's leading you to look at it 3,000 IPOs what happened to them three of them went well so then why do you want to invest in IPO do just invest in normal stock market put sip it's like a quote by Nan right n says uh every body knows how to get rich it's just that they want to get rich quickly yeah and that's the problem prik no matter what you do people are always going to do stupid stuff and IPOs are going to sell like hot cakes probably did someone say cake thank you so I think the next episode should be about package food dude that is such a lame attempt to cutting the next episode in the next episode we'll talk about packaged foods that you'll get a perspective hit that like And subscribe see you in the next [Music] one",

know that yet so let's see what will they pick hi anishita hold this which one will you choose this one this one that one i'll go for this one why because it's bigger and brighter it looks better i think it's more red and a big in size also what if i tell you this is a genetically modified tomato mhmm and this one is organic now what will you do now i'll choose the other one the organic one then i'll choose that one fume because i heard that they use injections and all to grow these crops so what if i get sick because i don't know what chemicals they put into it and how it will impact my body this might cause me allergies i think i've heard that there's some liver disease that happened so these guys were not able to tell the difference but can you so as you can see people can't tell the difference between gmo and non gmo but everyone has an opinion on it so in this episode we'll talk about what is gmo hey abid what's up hey so tell me what the hell is gmo humans love tinkering with nature's design and feel like god one of the oldest examples is artificial selection yes this artificial selection has been a thing since way back when the cavemen first figured out you could get different doggo varieties by letting only the chillest wolves make puppies basically we bred only the traits we wanted and bred out the traits we didn't and once we graduated from the caveman life to this crazy little thing called agriculture we just had to keep messing with nature's menu all of us are so choosy aren't we by picking which plants and animals got to pass their genes to the next generation we essentially hacked the system and all those years of selective breeding and artificial selection gave us the modern day crops like corn and animals like the american jersey cow who by the way are wildly different from their ancestors thank you genetic engineers i'm sure nothing bad will come from radically shaping species just because we can but hey enough about ancient history today we're basically living in a gattaca level future to directly gene hacking organisms into genetically modified organisms or gmo for short unlike what people think gmos are not made by artificial breeding or injecting chemicals into crops they're actually made inside labs where scientists alter the dna of crops to produce the desired traits drought resistant crops check herbicide proof super plants why not we're basically bioengineering dino sized products over here no biggie it's just like that if it ever backfires like in science fiction it'll be fine right right right guys well let's explore this topic of artificial selection and gmos a little more in detail and then maybe you can decide if humans playing god is good for the future or not god but this has been happening for a while right like i mean think about it artificial selection has been happening for some time now yep all the race horses yep actually even the grey hound which is bred which is which is artificially selected to run yep all these kinds of animals are actually selected in such a way that they can actually run races and win i'm sure the camels in arabia are also selected like this correct so they'll take a lit litter yep they'll pick the dogs which ran the fastest yep breed them again yep and keep going and over ten twenty 30 generations yep they'll find really fast dogs absolutely and this is artificial selection same thing with cows high yielding varieties of the holstein in fact interesting thing that you mentioned horses so you know what is the name which you give to race horses there's a specific name they are called taro breads oh right they are bred for that purpose for that purpose same for arabian horses right arabian horses are not really into the racehorse running scene i guess i'm not sure a lot of them are done for beauty as well right yes which is another beautiful of artificial selection yeah so so yeah cows horses dogs as you mentioned plenty of selective breeding happening for centuries means if we go back in time we will not see those special cows which yield so much of milk 100% it will be far far less 100% and then humans changed it for what we needed but it's done over a longer period of time what about natural selection so that's the thing right so there are some instances where naturally this can intermingle for example below a lot of below trees a lot of orchids grapefruit which is found i think in the caribbean or some area like that that was not a naturally occurring plant the first time it happened when there was a sweet orange which occurred there which mixed with another fruit called pomelo and then grapefruit came around there are natural instances where crossbreeding has happened also so yes there is natural crossbreeding then we also have like artificial crossbreeding right so we have like a tiger that is us doing it yeah that's us right and and then we get the liger we actually have like these images these videos of ligers walking around but i think they don't exist anymore so in nature it is very difficult to get a lion and tiger to you know go behind the bushes and and flowers come like how in nineteen nineties movie flowers come and like bees are pollinating that's kind of imagery they don't do it so point is but in a in a captivity they do it they do it mules horses because you made them do it you didn't make them you gave like flower background and they so the point is genetic changes in species has happened over centuries over a long time absolutely in our food absolutely in animals absolutely in flowers yep it's been there for a while yep yep 100% this is not new this is not new like we discussed genetic tinkering is basically humanity's oldest pastime but playing mad scientist by crossbreeding over many generation was kid stuff it wasn't until 1973 that we unlocked the real treasure decoding dna's genetic code scientists at stanford created the first genetically modified organism that year by implanting bacterial cells within a gene from a virus a microbe infused with an alien dna i wonder what could go wrong but it was really this the flavr savr tomato in 1994 that ushered the gmo food error tweaked to delay over ripening it was the first gene hacked crop approved for human consumption today gmos are utterly inescapable over over 90% of major crops in countries like in the usa have corn soy cotton they're all genetically engineered modified to be herbicide resistant drought proof fortified with extra nutrients and whatnot however in countries like india we still have not adapted to gmo to a large extent and the only widespread gmo in use here is something called bt cotton and we'll talk about bt cotton later but first let's look at the present situation we're like horticultural gamers today cultivating our dream crops down to the genetic code with glorified cut and paste tools like the crispr it's like we're playing farmville or something and that's where the controversy comes we're held in dozens of cities around the world today against gmos gmo gmos gmos genetically modified organisms people care about what they're putting in their bodies and they want to know what's in the products that they are eating so they can make that decision deregulated the gmo industry we don't eat no gmo say no to gmo hell no gmo who in many ways would prefer that people not know what is in the food that they produce with big seed companies playing mix and match with plant genomes many argue we're opening a pandora's box of unintended consequences potential threats could be toxic side effects mutated superbugs and an ecosystem disruption disruption could have plenty of folks calling for gmo regulation and maybe an outright ban but of course the biotech bros are here to argue that genetic engineering is simply hyper accelerating the age old practice of artificial selection but hey modern food science has to start somewhere right what do you think no but the thing about gmo is there's extremes the people who love it they say this is the future yay solution and there are people on the other side who say hey chemical we cannot do this this is harming the environment it sucks what do you think okay so i'll be very honest right rather than taking an absolute stand against something i'll kind of tend to look at who's behind it right so for example jonas sartre invented polio vaccine amazing man right or or or oral polio vaccine he was the guy who was behind it and he said this vaccine does not belong to me it belongs to humanity and he donated the patent of the vaccine to some university or something i think and which is why billions of children get oral polio vaccine every year for correct i think this is one of the monumental moments of science where men of science and women of science told that boys listen we are here to save the planet there's no greater shining example of science being altruistic than the polio vaccine but if a pharma company comes up with a vaccine i'm like so commercial interest i i yeah i can't trust the yeah i i can't trust the reason why somebody is doing something if there is shareholder value maximization involved and that's just me right but if a if a person of science does it right if if isro launches a rocket i'm like probably they're doing it for the country but if spacex launches i really don't know what's going on in the agenda and not that i have any definitive proof but you get the better my single biggest source of skepticism against mass proliferation of gmo is that it is mostly done by i don't know what they are called big seed big gmo big something big seed but big commercial interest right and yeah yeah yeah i this is my problem let's say that there is a point 000005% chance that a gmo can cause let's say a 3% impotency in you just just impotency why that's what everybody is bothered about right there's nothing else i know people are bothered about that more than that half like if i tell somebody that there is a 50% chance of a really gruesome death if you smoke cigarettes versus in next three years you might have slight importers you'll be like boss i'm quitting today in fact i think the labels on cigarettes say that in cigarette packet learning instead of saying boss you might become impotent tomorrow half the people will say right so if if there is a trade off like that then the world organization will say that boss everybody around the world smart people will agree that they could these are negligible statistical odds therefore it's probably better to do gmo because it feeds much more people greater common good is better although there's a sliver of people who might be adversely impacted so maybe gmo has a problem maybe gmo does not have a problem no i but everybody is incentivized not to make people panic correct correct most people make decisions not on the basis of data like even this show we say we'll show data in the end every decision is an emotional decision correct if people think that there is a fruit there is an injection and there is some chemical inserted and they feel that's what gmo is or whatever people will not gravitate towards it at all because every decision is an emotional decision correct there's another thing right even if you're not having gmo even if you're having a normal fruit there's so much pesticide insecticide in it which probably has a 100 x probability of giving you cancer than some inconclusive evidence about some gmo giving you something exists yeah so people get worried about the wrong things they go don't worry there's a point 001% of g gmo so maybe that's why the scientific community is gravitating towards so if you ask me do i trust gmo i don't know because i know the world make decisions based on what people can handle the mainstream narrative of every single thing in the world depends on what people can handle if you've liked the episode so far hit that like and subscribe and don't forget to comment so my question is would people move towards jmo if it made logical sense or is there something else over here does it just not feel right because you don't trust it so like i said right part of the reason is that people have a tendency to resist anything unnatural till it becomes normal correct right that's a very legit concern i mean even i have a concern and let's acknowledge it right if you objectively look at gmos they are probably twenty twenty five years when it old when it comes to food we eat maybe i am pretty sure it's not more than 50 years old which is not which is which is recent it's not long enough data to conclude anything and also you have to look at it as a lens that there's a lot of money being pumped in to make sure that a wrong information so a lot of capitalism controls a lot of big pharma and big seed and also a lot of media even if there is something very controversial about gmo if the media houses around the world are controlling the same tools who control big pharma what are the odds that they let that news float and to add to that you mentioned media pharma and big seed i don't know what they're called these are not even five companies each which control four companies everything yeah yeah that's scary that is scary but obviously they control the narrative like we talked about evs you can just change the story one problem here is we don't really know how it will react in the natural environment the concern is like we were talking is that one crop breeds with another crop in the natural environment and something else happens which we cannot predict correct and because all of life is connected to each other the water table the roots some other tree the food what would happen to the entire system yeah what if we literally introduce a virus correct and something happens to our food system correct that's one huge concern correct i've not how would we even test for that i don't think you can really test long term impact of what happens when you introduce a new organism in the nature but see the thing is this right if it's very specifically controlled gene modifications so at some point we also have to be rational enough key suddenly let's say that there's a way in which we can make blonde haired children or blue eyed boys literally right what if he grows like ten hands tomorrow that is paranoia yeah yeah so at some point we have to understand that okay if it's very lab controlled if if it is very precise and you exactly know that this gene controls only this thing and i think add to that right the effect of time if you do this over another five decades i'm i'm sure we'll figure it out but we're definitely not there yet yeah but the problem of course is in the process where this thing becomes dominant species what is the cost that other species will pay is less debated so for example earlier we were saying right there's a herbicide problem where instead of making plants which are resistant to insects you're probably making plants which are resistant to insecticides because you know you can sell insects anymore but the problem is now you'll spray a lot more insecticide one problematic thing rather is we don't know if we spray indiscriminate amounts of something which is poisonous to one species what else it will affect but even the local farm is affected right like we said that a certain kind of crop is resistant to herbicide yeah so the farmer will come and he'll start spraying lots of herbicide without worrying about it correct and to take care of weeds correct not all weeds are bad correct if all weeds are taken care of gone from there the farm looks different looks cleaner but now you have soil erosion issues correct there are a whole host of other issues which have propped up to try to solve a singular problem without thinking the network effect it has on the entire farm but again we have to be cognizant very mindful of the fact that gmo did not cause the problem the gmo which was created to sell more chemical is the problem maybe abid is right maybe the problem lies in how gmos are used and not the gmos themselves but but before we take that decision let's quickly go through some of the problems that could exist directly due to gmos now while genetic engineering has given us modern marvels like drought resistant crop and vitamin boosted bananas plenty of people have serious objections so let's understand this through three different perspectives one on the health front critics warn that tinkering with nature's source code could produce unexpected toxins and trigger new food allergies a 2020 analysis found about fifty one percent of people believe gmos likely pose health risks and think about it the long term impact of ingesting gmos is still largely untested over multiple generations right so we could be guinea pigs in an uncontrolled experiment number two then there are ecological concerns genetically modified super crops that are designed to survive high concentration of herbicides well they could breed herbicide resistant superweeds now while on one hand gm crops help decrease the use of pesticide on the other hand it's increased herbicide use by a whopping two thirty nine million kilograms number three the ethical debate is also a philosophical nightmare even if gmos end up becoming technically safe critics question the morality of corporations patenting seeds that produce 80% of our food globally but of course advocates counter that genetic engineering is simply an extension of artificial selection that humans have practiced over ten thousand years of agriculture either way one thing is clear the rise of genetically modified organisms on our dinner plates has opened up a door we may never be able to close one of these manufacturers says that we've created this kind of crop take our seeds it will be resistant to insects but sometimes that's not what's happening is it i don't know what's happening sometimes the insect actually gets resistant to that type of crop and still attacks it and despite using the gm crop you mean this to the kind of chemical that's being used toxin it's emitting to get resistant to that kind of yep yep he gets resistant and so it's just like antibiotic resistant bacteria same thing basically you we did everyone out yeah every insect out which so only ones who are left are resistant and then they migrate reproduce and that becomes a new strain so basically indirectly you're genetically selectively breeding the insects insects which are resistant to toxins so but what's interesting right as a capitalist this is a great opportunity now you have bt two bt three but you do realize that it is an opportunity that eventually leads to we are all dying exactly the same thing happens with cotton right like you look at it as an independent individual farmer like when a pest or a weed comes and attacks his cotton crops yeah the easiest thing for that thing to say is yeah this year i'm going to get so badly affected because my crop is like going to die because of this insect there are two thought process for him one spray the insecticide right the other is nay if i do this as a community as a whole this will create pesticide insecticide resistant insect nobody likes it no one thinks like that so again it's about creating very tempting incentives right so this cannot be solved at a farmer level just like how antibiotic resistance if somebody is falling sick you cannot lecture him if you don't have this antibiotic now tomorrow there'll be a better world nobody's going to listen to that this happened with this bt cotton right so the bt cotton is supposed to save the farmer from ball worms and now the farmers are reporting that the ballworms are resistant to that kind of toxin in the gm crop correct and the ballworms are back correct so now what now you have to find something which kills the new variety of ballworms so part two new addition seed yeah it won't it won't end it's just like anti vertex it will never end so this is going to be a massive serious ecological concern because the amount of organisms which are evolved to fight chemicals will proliferate so much that your chemicals have to be much much more deadly going ahead and if if if it's not a different chemical but it's a stronger deadlier chemical this is not going to end well tell me this i i generally don't know okay in financial markets yeah we have the consumer and we have the manufacturer yeah and in between we have sebi yeah to make sure that the because the incentives are actually never aligned for these two parties to sort of add rules and regulations to align them correct now in this entire thing that we're talking we're talking about pharma we're talking about these guys shouldn't environmentalists play a huge role in all of this like where is their say where are the researchers saying because the researchers are hired by the manufacturer in this case correct where is the autonomous body of researchers saying no between the farmer and the manufacturer does this exist anywhere i think there's a regulatory body all over the world in every country which approves the use of a new chemical on anything like fda equivalent fda equivalent is there in every but do they really enforce it i don't think so right no i think they are being enforced because for example right i think in india a lot of gmos are not proliferated because they don't have the permission i think bt cotton has permission which is why it's saying and there's no other gmo allowed i don't think there are other gmos being widely approved on so there is regulation but the problem is this right it's really really difficult for a regulator to take a stance on its own against something where there is so much money riding i mean that's why it's a difficult job even rating agencies right i mean it's like big shot openly says no fifa fifa like i mean i mean like it's everywhere too much money can and kind of buy anything i mean let's face it there's no way escaping that okay wait let's pause for a moment and take a deep breath although there are certain key issues on the flip side genetic engineering could just be the key to solving some of humanity's biggest food problems like feeding our ever ballooning population as our planet heats up thanks to climate change experts estimate we'll need to roughly double our food production by 2,050 to feed about 10,000,000,000 people but rising temperatures droughts and soil degradation put a serious damper on crop years this is where gmos come to the rescue biotech wizards have already turbocharged stable crops to be drought tolerant pest resistant and equipped with productivity boosting traits like fungal defenses we're talking about everything from flood proof rice that can survive underwater for over two weeks to biofortified bananas packed with enough vitamin a to prevent up to 700,000 kids from going blind each year speaking of nutrition switching out genes has already given us all sorts of fortified superfoods there's golden rice enriched with vitamin a and soya beans expressing genes for healthy omega three fatty acids i mean heck there's even hypoallergic peanuts for those 32,000,000 americans with life threatening nut allergies but it's not just food where gmos could make a massive impact there's also our growing energy needs needs we rapidly bioengineering biofuel feedstock like algae and biodiesel crops as a replacement to fossil fuels then we have medical needs like say insulin production with just one single gmo insulin source meeting over forty percent of global diabetes demand and guess what gene editing may even let us basically grow plant based polymers as a natural biodegradable replacement for for plastic alright alright obviously lots of this future biotech sounds uncomfortably like a sci fi movie but if it lets us sustainably feed billions curb diseases kick fossil fuel addiction and save the planet that's something pretty tough to argue with right well before jumping to any conclusions let's see what these two guys have to talk about the pros of gmos so gmos are way more high yielding right even naturally selected ones which were cross bred were high yielding i mean we don't have too many better examples of this than right here at home yeah green revolution was selective breeding of high yielding varieties of rice and wheat right and now look at the gmo twist of it so genetic engineering was brought in to achieve this selective breeding which took over a process i mean normal selective breeding takes months if not years so you can achieve much better results much faster resulting in much higher yielding crops so you can scale faster scale way faster and feed all of us feed every person bringing down the cost drastically and this problem is increasing worldwide right like we'll get to 10,000,000 people by 2050 we definitely not at the current pace we'll run out of food so there's no denying that a lot of mouths are getting fed because of things like grain enrichment although there are concomitant negative effects like use of sa but at the end of the day you can't be like a complete anti technology natural person who says that you are a boss people will die of hunger if you are taking that stance so this is undeniable secondly you could actually add a nutrient to a particular kind of food very sad and now you have it so like we have vitamin a in rice we have omega in soya bean what else there is bio certified sorghum there is high vitamin a in tomatoes there is folic acid in soybeans i mean there are plenty of soybeans and this actually reduces populations which have a deficiency and actually saves better quality of life etcetera yeah the most famous example of course being the one you quoted which is called golden rice in east asia but the the the catch is this right it won't end here there are so many things the possibilities in future are endless you realize that a particular deficiency causes a particular thing let's say let's say a high dose of vitamin d reduces the risk of x kind of cancer or let's say there are vegetarians in the world who can't have access to vitamin b twelve because it doesn't so if you can somehow create genetic engineering which results in vitamin b producing proteins in some plant then for a lot of people who are vegetarians by choice because of their setting and reason they will get the benefit thanks to this genetic engineering sorry yeah right so this change is very welcome and you can practically engineer foods which exactly go and hit the exact protein that you need to be resistant to this disease or having this trait or being healthy in this way etcetera etcetera so that's also like a world of possibilities that awaits us so another very very visible out there possibility that we can all see when it comes to gmos is they are resistant to diseases so from a farmer's perspective they don't get attacks like so i think there was a hawaii in papaya which used to get a virus so in hawaii papaya is a very widely grown plant and i think some kind of virus was affecting every papaya they brought in gmo to the action and the new papaya strain did not have virus so pharmacology is great yeah because you have their chance to zero reduces yeah chances they can get bankrupt of the entire so they have crops which don't get affected by viruses they also have plants that don't need so if if there's a plant which is getting attacked by an insect if the plant itself is resistant to the insect they don't have to spend on insecticide so i think in the us very very very 90% or i think some really large number like that is all gm crop yeah yeah and if you look at this chart all of the yields have gone up throughout and you can see that the number all of the yields have actually gone up and the usage of pesticide has gone down drastically so here's the fact that this has happened yeah yeah this has happened so that's one more benefit that you have and and of course you have to give it to the environment also because if you are having plants which are insect resistant weed resistant etcetera then you don't spray so much herbicide or insecticide or weedicide so the use of chemical decreases yeah in a in a perfectly ideal world in an ideal world where crops are engineered to be resistant to insects and not the chemical they are also engineered to look a certain way right like have you seen the spotless banana like the spotless guava like it just looks seedless watermelon seedless watermelon so so that is also a good thing right you there is a very positive effect on nature because the use of chemicals is being cut down because of gmos so now there are a bunch of misconceptions that people still have so avid will say a misconception we'll try to answer it based on whatever humanity has so far let's see if we can do this go i'm going to put on my imaginary reading glasses for this the biggest concern with gm crops is that they may breed with non gm crops due to which their genes will get transferred to normal crops which may affect the entire ecosystem of plants negatively and it is also creating trust issues among customers interesting here's the truth so far this has never happened there is no instance of this happening having said that it doesn't mean that it could not happen in the future but so far no instance recorded misconception number two they may cause allergic reactions because of their altered dna and we don't know the long term effects of growing and consuming these crops that's actually a really fair point what we know so far is over the last twenty years america has been what 90% gm crop we've not seen any noticeable reactions to the population over over that but having said that twenty years is still not a large enough time scale to know all the effects agriculture is about 10,000 years old twenty years is piddly in compared to that we probably need a few more decades but so far no evidence for this and what's interesting is a bunch of studies have said that none of this happens it's actually safe now i don't know who's funding these studies but this is the information we have so far i see misconception number three in gm crops genes are altered so that the crop creates a poison to kill insects so if we eat that same crop that poison will be bad for us as well oh interesting so here's the truth this is pretty straightforward engineering means you engineered for a specific type of behavior poison is relative poison for an insect may not be poison for humans so it's engineered like that of course it is not poisonous for humans we all have consumed some kind of gm crop at some point and of course it's not so this is unfounded for example chocolates are great for humans i know you like it no you don't but it's really bad for dogs it's almost instant death if you give chocolate to a dog so poison is relevant fair point point number four some insects have developed resistance to the toxins in gm insect resistant crops to kill them farmers need to use much stronger chemicals which are expensive and cause pollutions totally fair if you think about it insecticide they would use anyway but with the gm crop actually you know that on a population level on a large sample size level overall insecticide use has fallen as you can see over here crop yields have increased and we've seen this in the us this is true second point you said second thing to address over here is the use of insecticide when there is resistance developed will they use more insecticide yes so this is a spiral where another gm crop will be introduced and i think that's just how the system has become so is gmo good or bad what do you think i have no idea we don't know we don't know what's your perspective put it in the comments and prateek will read it bye bye",

    "transcript_full": "[Music] it is supposed to come till here who asked for this pink Ros by I said red roses what are you doing why have you hello sir good afternoon sir it's my marriage but why would you call me to a location we have a nice office getting married I have to plan so R we have a meeting right yes let's do it here only let's do it here yeah yeah you just come with me sir I have to block decoration internal decoration to change the flowers I was married 9 years ago I've been through what you have been through and you have this marriage after one month right isaro just a second and you're probably spending a bomb over here right you and your uh 50 50% it's and it's a big amount I'm sure right so it's a big Indian we can talk about some ways you can actually save some money and get some mental peace without compromising on all these things that you want quality same and to be honest and to be honest even I did not know some of these things back then so at least you should do it and it'll take 10 minutes done sir done ready let's do it yes sir so maybe we can cover all of it in like four points no one should see this so I think the first question you guys need to answer is what what kind of wedding do you actually want me and my fiance yeah so me and my fiance want a big fat Indian wedding H take take H we'll do all that but this is going to cost a lot of money right yes sir we have utilize our savings me and fiance 100% how are you managing it sir we have opted for mnpl with our savings mnp what is that new cricket team fancy term so it's marry now pay later so I'm getting married right now I'll pay the amount later are you serious is someone scamming him I no it's a legit thing okay tell me about it okay so it's different from Marriage loan oh sorry it's different from normal bank loan so hold on okay you can marry now but you can pay it later it's basically debt it's a Lo it's a loan l no no yes it's a loan but they'll also help me in you know connecting with these Wenders skaters decorators that's that's not going to happen with bank loan because they they'll just give me the money and I'll have to utilize that so you're saying a personal loan is just a loan but an mmpl loan is specific for a marriage marage yes and they'll help me with everything connect with connect me with the vendors and decorations these guys know locations videographers have to tell them yes oh okay and what else is the like well low interest rate as compared to the as compared to a normal bank loan plus some flexibility in terms of payments and I think they have a very not very strict criteria in terms of credit score evaluation as compared to a normal if you have a low credit score they'll give you the money no no no I don't think so but they don't have super hard checks is what I know okay to be honest we didn't have mnpl back then but this sounds pretty uh good if the interest rate is low so whether basically it's a loan okay and it's a specialized loan for your marriage correct assuming the company and all you choose is correct I think four things you should check for sure and you should check in any loan you should check in the mnpl loan as well so the first thing is what's the interest rate you should check no you should check with the personal loans of normal Banks to see whether um it's actually um lower or not I don't think you should be taking a loan anyway but this is a personal choice so I won't comment on it it's fine don't over leverage yourself obviously so make sure the interest rate is actually lower second what's the penalty if you pay early like a prepayment oh so you should check the fine print ask them if I pay a little early in case you get a bonus yes not now later in case he gets a bonus then you know you are able to prepay what's the penalty on that you should know that third um how often are you paying and how long is the tenure you should know what are the payment options what if you skip an Emi Etc I have to compare this with a normal loan no you should compare it with a normal loan but you should also ask the rules of how this works and finally what's the actual limit that you're sanctioned for you don't want the actual expense to be this much and the mnpl to cover only this much it has to cover a decent to give them a total estimate and obviously your last thing I hope you have your basic Personal Finance in order up right and you can't be overleveraging yourself and what is the Emi for this compared to your entire salary it can't be too much anyway but this is an interesting thing to think about take this is this has been the second thing is unbundling and bundling of services so this is actually a really cool hack so you're probably paying uh for venue and catering and photograph obviously that's why I'm taking the okay cool loan and there's obviously GST on everything right right so if you actually Club catering and venue together you don't pay 18% GST you pay 5% GST so that's actually pretty cool hack if you actually include catering and the venue in the same bill okay by the same person then the GST is 5% but if you included something like say decoration and say Photography in it it'll become 18% on the full bill so you save a lot actually because outflow is less oh I'll just take about check with the with the manager here not right now n my time is more important than two more points you finish the two more points so I think if you unbundle it like this overall you can save like a decent amount from your total bill right I think so 5% versus 18% and catering is one of the largest costs right correct all that food all that wastage wastage never mind Point number three three so this means you can actually save 10 to 20% on your total bill because maybe what 30 40 50% is follow this point yeah like more than 40% would be catering in venue right right unless you're doing itani way where you have Justin Bieber coming this is the only place entertainment will be more but not not the case no got [Music] it I am your student I have Excel sheet over here Excel cheat for everything yes of course okay so look at this over here you can see the bundling and unbundling of costs M so let's talk about the big ticket items okay um we have the venue and Catering so if you rent a venue by itself without any catering you'll have to pay 18% GST whether it's with hotel rooms or not so let's say we have case number one where where you don't bundle your expenses if everything is separate the total costs ends up to this 15.22 lakhs now let's look at case number two when you bundle and unbundle a little smartly in this case you combine the venue and Catering to get that 5% GST while the rest you know like decor and videography Etc that will be taxed at 18% just by doing this your total expenses decrease a little bit to 14.96 lakhs and then we have case number three what most people do most of the time the the venue providers will offer a package that includes everything venue be catering Decor videography but here's the catch you'll pay 18% GST on the whole package which is much much higher than just venu in catering combo so in this scenario the cost jumps to 16.52% you bundle and unbundle these expenses you can actually save about 133% on GST payable in this example that's about 1.56 lakh saved which is almost 10% of your entire wedding budget let's get back to the episode to participate in abishek karat so you got it right yeah that's that's cool but you know what Schooler in your wedding or on your wedding day you'll get lots of gifts obviously you'll also gift me now yeah I'll gift you watch so that you come on time to the office forget about that around your wedding you will get gifts right this could be stocks bonds cash could be gold could be Electronics could be a car all of these things that your friends gift you or people gift you is not taxable just make sure if you get cash deposit it in your bank account around the wedding day so you know it's proof that it's from it's shagun even though it's probably not a lot no it'll be it'll be it'll be it'll be it'll be and then and then you know it's just not taxed then there comes property oh some if someone gift me a house if someone gives you a house you actually don't pay tax on it but there is a catch yeah there's a catch the catch is that you'll pay stamp Duty okay up to 50,000 Rupees the house should be gifted to you by an unrelated party so unrelated party someone who's not your relative why would he give me a house I don't know I don't make these this is the income tax are you get it okay and of course if you generate rent from that property MH then you pay tax on it and then finally we have the last Point wedding Insurance oh oh wedding insurance is that where are we going okay I don't know let's not go here let's let's just go come just sit here it's a good view come so wedding insurance is basically if you have any cancellations due to unforeseen events then the wedding insurance basically covers it and where are you going sit here I'm not sitting here God it's my so any unforeseen event that happens like a cancellation due to like a man-made event or natural Calamity and the wedding's not happening the insurance comes into effect if tufan comes and destroys everything I'll get the money oh that's interesting so I did not also Co right like Co is a very good example and it basically costs why do you want to do everything now do it later 22 to 4% of your total cost will roughly be the cost of the insurance oh that's the premium yeah that's the premium you pay the total cost of the budget 2% is going to be the premium yeah huh to yeah it's a good thing to have to be honest I didn't even know that insurance existed uh until after we got married but it's a cool thing I think everyone should consider at least that's interesting I'll just tell my sir I have one question so what it doesn't cover so um I don't know stuff like extreme pollution I mean anyway stuff like kidnapping uh War terrorism stuff like that is not uh is not covered oh so what's the term of this insurance plan so your wedding is a day two day before or after it'll cover a few days before your wedding let's say 7 days and the day the wedding's over up to the next day is till when this is actually coming oh that's interesting are there any companies who does that I mean I mean you you know the dude you have a phone you're intelligent just Google it oh sir my fiance is calling me I'll give you privacy no no it's okay hii vedding what hello she said did she say cancel I heard yeah she said she's not going [Music] to this is wrong relax relax what did she say ja [Music]",

    "title_current": "True REALITY of Billionaires",
    "transcript_full": "what am i worth billionaires off their presence in network in net worth the richest person in the world net worth are you a billionaire yet bro net worth net worth net worth net worth i've got individual net worth okay something was definitely not right here you think about net worth in so many ways and are bombarded on the internet in podcasts and magazines and people talking about how much money they have 100 x more than you and it makes you feel like shit so in this episode we're gonna talk about the reality of net worth we're gonna talk about the good and the bad because clearly the media and the internet are not telling you the truth so let's begin where did this concept even come from so let's go back in time in the agrarian society where everyone would grow up on the field grow a bunch of stuff eat it and be self sustainable but then came the industrial revolution in the west and at this time there were factories mass production there was advertising to buy stuff place for all your food beauty and dependability this is the year to own the car designed for you and this gave birth to two anxiety inducing worked for a second hour you would pay for that this worked for a second hour you would pay for that this is where people associated time with money and the word time is money also was born and this would enable you to lead a better life because that's what advertising told us and because of consumerism people wanted to buy stuff now the richest people weren't the landlords like the agrarian societies they were the vanderbilts the rockefellers and other people and their net worth ironically was a lot these industrialists made a lot of money so now money became status and became something that you wanted and all these newly rich people acquired stuff you didn't have so this was not about money anymore it was about i'm better i am better my status is nicer my home is nicer my cars are nicer my friends are nicer my clothes are nicer i'm better than you so self worth came from net worth kinda sucks but that's what happened but when someone earns a lot of money when you look at your net worth it's too much money to even spend in a lifetime you were like the youngest person to become a billionaire and people talk about in the media that this person has made a lot of money is it really wrong of course not they probably earned it but there's a problem here it's called net worth anxiety don't look it up i just made it up it's a problem when you see another person's net worth and have this feeling of feeling of emptiness inside and wastelessness actually two problems happen the first one is anxiety by comparison you look at this other person who's made more money than you and you perceive yourself to be lesser than this person because this person is younger or richer or better looking or whatever it is some one aspect that you don't have in your life that creates anxiety the second problem is the medal effect remember when you did something amazing at school and you earned a medal maybe it was a picture maybe it was marks but something that you were proud of you ran home to your mother or father and said look my papa this is what i got and they were so happy they told all their friends all their relatives this could also be a talent and everyone was proud of you and that moment was just bliss and beautiful and now as an adult you want to recreate that and net worth is one way that you tell your parents that you've reached this net worth all your friends and families become proud of you and if you don't hit it then they are not proud of you the internet amplifies everything and it amplifies net worth too particularly how net worth is displayed on the internet many times you won't see rich people talking about their money in fact most rich people will not talk about their money the media talks about it and the media is not a representation of this person's mind and the media mis represents it so let's talk about all the misrepresentations of network that happen that mess up your mind magazine rich list i love this popular magazines make list of rich people and the number keeps going higher and higher as you go up the rank obviously and becomes billions of dollars there are indian rich lists as well and you look at them and think oh my god that's so much money i mean 10,000 crores what and you think i'm earning a salary of 50,000 rupees and this person is 10,000 crores i don't believe this one you shouldn't because it's not true the net worth is a calculation of all their assets put together that billionaire salary might be zero and he might have a lot of money in cash but the point is salary salary you can compare don't compare net worth and your salary that makes no sense a great way to find out how much you are worth is going to the description downloading this calculator and plugging it all in normally on the first of every month we look at our salary and say this is what i'm worth but that's not true you're actually worth a lot more than just the assets you have but because you are lost in life once you can do this exercise add everything including your you know that you have achieved something anyway let's get back the thing with these lists is that they're linked to the ownership of their companies whose valuation is available publicly so to calculate their net worth is easy but for everyone else it's impossible no one really knows the net worth of someone who isn't running a public company because these are private individuals so when you hear that this x person is worth x in the media most likely it was done to get clicks on their website the media company's website where they own ads there is no way to know what shah rukh khan is actually worth let alone what a youtuber is worth and this is exactly what happened with kylie jenner i can't believe i'm talking about it but i promise it's about net worth she was doing some $300,000,000 in revenue as she explained in an interview some magazine came applied some pe multiple to it and said billion dollars she owns 100% of it oh my god she's the youngest billionaire ever ever ever and every minute made a huge big deal about it in '20 i think she was worth a billion dollars it's crazy everyone went nuts and she probably made more sales because of this news how amazing what a business person what an entrepreneur what a playa and because all of this hype the media companies got a lot of traffic ads worked everyone's a winner i'm sure the fans are also happy fast forward to 2019 kylie sold kylie cosmetics 51% stake to this company and it is revealed that her sales were not 300,000,000 a few years ago it was 80 to 100,000,000 which made her worth only a couple $100,000,000 oh my god what a cheat and because of this everyone called her a liar including the media companies who again made hype of it and earned from the ads wow so basically you can't trust the network calculations you see online because the information is not public okay okay and one more thing that's causing you net worth anxiety is this this meme where if jeff bezos start giving out $1,000,000 a day every day it'll take him five hundred years for all his money to finish which means he is way ahead of the game do you think he has that much money in the bank net worth is not cash in bank but the point is stuff like this is anxiety inducing and designed like that to make you feel like you're not even close but this is not even true so the amount of shares he owns in amazon multiplied by the stock price at that time becomes a part of his net worth and that's what people assume is how much money he has but he doesn't have that in cash it's just his net worth it's an asset in fact there's this really cool company called basecamp this guy actually runs this company profitably for the last many many years and they do millions of dollars in profits you've probably not heard of them which is why i love this example they even send their employees for paid holidays on their bucket list which i think is fantastic they also enjoy their work they're completely remote etcetera etcetera and people kept asking him what's your net worth what's the valuation guys they never raised any capital so as a joke he raised a few dollars from his friend at a 0.00001% valuation and he announced to the world that he's worth a $100,000,000,000 so now whenever someone asks him what's the valuation of your company he says a $100,000,000,000 and it's a joke to illustrate that you can just sell your startup right now for 10 rupees at 0 you get the point and tell the world that you're worth x but nothing will change now there are two types of news headlines you hear one is the new startup founder for the last one to five years that his worth is now 100 crores 200 crores 300 crores 1,000 crores you name it in india i have to pay a number and you think he did it in two years he did it in four years this is too quick in most cases if the company is only a few years old the founders do not have liquidity liquidity means they don't have cash the company may be worth a certain amount because they have to grow but the founders don't participate and get part of that cash their job as operators is to grow the company so in most cases they don't have money in the bank so guy worth say hundreds of crores may only have 50 lakhs in his account which is not bad by the way but that's the truth then there's a second kind of founder also worth say thousand crores 5,000 crores but he's been at it for a decade or two maybe even three and these kinds of entrepreneurs because they've been at it for a long time get to participate in something called a liquidity event a liquidity event is when the founder can actually cash in on some of the stock he owns and get some money in the bank this could be an ipo it just could be a bonus it could be a dividend it could be a secondary sale but it's rare and when it happens they get a lot of cash good example is flipkart they actually made thousands of crores from the sale to walmart but such events are rare so remember the next time you see that a startup founder is worth hundreds or thousands of crores see how much time he's put in it if it's a really long time there's a good chance some of it he actually has in cash but in most cases they may not and ignore it and live your life a little bit better but look at all these people these musicians sports people boxers actually had liquid millions of dollars in their account but went bankrupt zero so maybe personal finance is a little important and i think you should protect your capital know how to compound get your emergency fund all those things are more important and not googling the net worth of your favorite star because you can't get it become better in your own cash that's probably better right and since you've removed all your other anxieties let me give you one more anxiety in the next fifty years you will be working so the last one or two or three years don't really matter and to be honest india has so much opportunity right now i just know you will be able to make it over the next decade and even a decade is so less think about it you're at home probably right now in an air condition there's a pankha you have water nice food and you're watching youtube on wi fi dude you'll be fine you have five decades of work ahead of you you're not going to compound you will be absolutely okay love you baby when you look at me i can see you're looking at me so don't look at me anxiety is not but you have a word when you were younger actually this word didn't exist yeah yeah kush that's your bluebird",

    "title_current": "Truth about lab grown diamonds!",
    "transcript_full": "so this is a natural diamond and this is a lab grown diamond and this is STI my wife my backbone we've been married for a decade and in 7 days we'll be celebrating our 10year wedding anniversary and I really really want to make this day special with a shiny diamond ring you see I understand that diamonds don't have any resale value if anything they are resold for less but I can't help but wonder if I pick a lab grown d Diamond does it mean that my love for Swati is cheaper that I feel like she's not worth a natural diamond so I dug deep into the diamond industry to find out what's made this piece of carbon an eternal symbol of love and I found 3 dir little [Music] secrets first things first why is this little Stone worth so much money why should I pay 10 lakh Rupees for this I mean it's made of carbon and so is this pencil but the pencils for 5 rupees and this is what 10 lakhs why to understand this you have to understand this guy sisil rhods who converted this rock into the ultimate symbol of love wait eternal love you see for centuries people thought diamonds were insanely rare because India was the only place they were found but everything changed in 1867 when a boy stumbled upon a 21 karat diamond in South Africa and this single discovery changed everything South Africa became a gold mine for diamonds mines were opening everywhere businesses were booming and in this chaos a young businessman saw the potential treasure that would make him filthy rich Cecil Road started deers in 1888 and began buying up mines left right and center but after owning so many mines Cil soon realized that diamonds were not rare Diamond production Rose from tens of thousands of carrots in the late 1860s to more than 1 million carats in 1872 and well that was the problem you see if there's too much Supply and the demand is less the prices naturally fall and if the opposite happens where the supply is too little and everyone wants something but it's freaking out of stock then the prices rise and that's exactly what debers did they set up different shell companies in Africa Europe England and even Israel to control the Diamond Supply different names same owner the beers they had created a diamond Monopoly what started with 13 mines turned to 125 Partners across the world but due to the world war and in the Great Depression diamond prices tank by 50% and to recover from this they had to do something I mean they controlled the world Supply they had to make money it's a business after all they had to turn something unvaluable into something invaluable and thus came the most successful marketing campaign in the history of the world a diamond is forever De Beers to increase the sales De Beers hired this advertising agency and their job was simple they have to turn this rock into a precious stone by saying that this Stone gives you status this Stone gives you love they gave diamonds to celebrities showed it in movies just to create this illusion that diamonds are actually precious the premise for this large scale marketing was simple if you were going to get married and you had to propose the only choice was a diamond ring but L's got a cost something right so De Beers said that yes it does cost something and it's 2 month salary cheers to that De Beers and there is proof of this like if you look at the data you'll see the sales of diamonds went from what 23 million to 2.1 billion in just about 40 years and de's marketing budget went from $200,000 all the way to 10 million bucks and the same perception existed in India too the Emperors and empresses and royalty had diamonds as part of their status and to show the change of power the kohinur was stolen from India taken to the British crown put on the actual crown to show world dominance and I agree with Shashi we need those reparations right the point is simple the diamond shows power class status and because this was such a part of culture it had value but logically it still doesn't make sense because if you think about it even the chairman of debir said this it's intrinsically worth nothing and even if you look at this chart over here you can see that in America people who bought a diamond and then tried to resell it the prices were lower consistently and the reason why this is significant is that any other precious metal and some precious stones actually go up in value but diamonds don't but that still doesn't answer my question and my predicament am I supposed to buy by this lab grown diamond or the natural diamond because a lab grown diamond isn't real right I mean think about it it's grown in a lab and the mind Diamond grew well through natural processes for millions of years that's what gives it actual value so I thought we should go a little deeper into lab grown diamonds a lab gr Diamond process is simple you start with something called a seed Diamond put it inside a machine there are a bunch of gases and chemical reactions that happen happen and after a month you have a diamond grown from scratch in this machine that's chemically optically and physically just like a real diamond the only difference is their origin so it turns out a lab grown diamond isn't actually fake it's like saying the ice in your fridge is fake and it's not real and the only ice in the world can only be found in the Arctic they're both ice it's just found in different places and the lab grown diamonds are actually more Environ ly friendly less water less energy consumption and of course it's not dangerous to humans because going inside a mine and extracting stuff isn't really safe but if a diamond can be made in 30 days is it even valuable for example this diamond over here is worth 1.2 lakh rupees of this quality and the same quality diamond which is natural is 14 lakhs 14 lakhs so what's the problem problem problem yeah everyone loves Diamond shiny beautiful a girl's best friend best friend best friend and you know what's the worst part mining a one karat diamond emits enough carbon to power a house for 3 Days sir 3 days you think that's it n sir mining destroys Forest pollutes Rivers exploits workers and leaves the entire Landscapes ruin even though we pay so much for these these these rocks it doesn't read the miners who risk their lives and help just to extract them so technically the real cost of diamond is deforestation labor exploitation Nature's destruction carbon emission or love symbol sir this industry is built on okay fine so there's so many problems with natural diamond so you'll buy a lab gr diamond right diamonds are so 2,000 natural diamond is best natural original best I'm not buying any diamonds obviously natural I would prefer natural okay so seems like a lot of people don't actually prefer a lab grown Diamond they want the real thing or should I say the real thing un natural diamond but one thing's clear people buy a natural diamond because of its emotional resonance so if that's true then should I buy a natural diamond or a lab gr Diamond okay so now I have to choose right this should be simple natural Diamond Classic everyone's been doing it for Generations it's trusted it's pure but then you have deforestation mining water pollution and it's 10x more expensive so then then maybe the lab gr Diamond because same Sparkle makes sense no pollution everything's good here right like it's a lab grown Diamond but what if she thinks I love her less okay focus she's right here there's no point contemplating the pros and cons we've already made our choice and I chose",

    "title_current": "91% options traders are LOSING MONEY! Here's Why.",
    "transcript_full": "sebbi says 91.1% of all fno Traders lose money and the average loss is 1.2 lakh rupees per person but my question is why is trading actually gambling so we spoke to a bunch of Traders the reason why I call this a scam is because I lost 1.7 CR in the first 3 4 years 60 70 LS and we looked at all the data to distill it into five reasons why trading is possibly gambling so let's start with the first reason dopamine addiction this is Rahul he started fno trading at the peak of the bull market in 2023 why very simple look at this chart it moves so much all he has to do is capture a couple of rupees and he can make a lot of money and he does he buys Bank Nifty right here and sells it right here within an hour and he made a good 5,000 rupees now to put this into perspective this guy makes 20,000 rupees a month from his salary and here he just made 5,000 with some basic analysis I mean this is Magic you see greed has no end so he starts trading more and more winning more and more losing more and more and this time it's a net loss but he doesn't stop because he thinks he can make it after all he made money last month right in fact the sebbi chief said they have anecdotal information that people are borrowing money from friends family even mortgaging their houses to trade more in the derivative segment that's how addictive this game is you putting in like four into one trade you forget about everything else right it's like you forget about family forget about everything else this is all there is so the question is this why don't they just hit the brakes and stop if they see that they're losing money and the answer is an interesting experiment happened a while back in the 1950s an American psychologist conducted a really sick experiment he took a group of mice and put them in water to see how long they would try to swim before giving up and drowning the first group did this for about 15 minutes before they gave up but the second group was actually rescued just before they gave up L rested they were dried and put back in the water and this group of mice ended up swimming for 60 hours they thought they'll eventually be rescued just like last time and they contined to swim for their lives we are just like these mice those small profits we make in the market they make us think that one day we'll hit it big and it's this hope that creates the seed for gambling I have some stats here I can see an FY 24 with an income of less than 5 lakh 92.2 % of people lost about 65,000 rupees each and people with income between 5 and 25 lakh 88.3% people lost money an average of 1.52 lakhs but the question is what makes these people even think in the first place that they can make money from options which brings us to the second reason online influence selling greed during covid a lot of influencers started promoting and selling the idea that you can make money from options sitting at home and they convinced you by showing their trading account of how much money they made in just a few hours on that day in some of these videos they talk about how you can make cors of rupees all you have to do is follow their style this by the way is not education this is called selling greed education is when you talk about options explain what they are and there's a full stop to it the moment you start selling the end result it becomes something entirely different 2020 the internet actually fueled all of this with the rise of ekyc you could now open an account online without those lengthy forms and because everyone was sitting at home watching all these videos the excitement for the market was high everyone opened accounts and because of all of these factors today in 2025 we have 45 lakh active derivative Traders up from about 7 lakh traders in 2019 now what lures people into option trading specifically is that the maximum loss is the amount you invest when you actually buy buy an option contract and the unlimited profit is what lures them into the greed side so they think by investing just a few th000 rupees they can actually make a lot of money but unlike stock trading which is equally tougher in options you also have to worry about other things outside of Direction like all these Greeks these are things newbie Traders have no idea about trading like any other skill requires a tremendous amount of effort it requires time skill energy people don't want do that so here's what they do which brings us to reason number three stock tips stock tips is a huge industry in India but it's totally a scan let me explain how it works now there is person X person X is asking orish to buy and Nishan to sell you know call options and put options for the same bloody exact same instrument right and what these guys are doing is and that's when I realized that holy I'm getting properly properly scammed right and it's not just telegram groups we also have influencers around the world and in India who talk about particular stocks for example this really famous influencer talked about a particular small cap stock which I also had never heard about and he said he added it to his portfolio and it's good in the short term this stock went all the way up and no surprises it then crashed this is called a pump and dump where the person bought it in advance told his followers about it exited and made a quick Buck at the expense of all of us but this doesn't mean all influencers are bad it just means if someone popular is trying to sell you greed you should be aware and this brings us to our fourth reason the odds are not in your favor there are only two kinds of players which actually make make money in this market these are foreign portfolio investors or proprietary Traders for example let's look at the about us page of a really famous quantitative hedge fund located abroad The Firm boasts 90 phds in mathematics physics computer science and other areas we also have really accomplished individuals a Maur fellow a fellowship literally known as The Genius Grant they have members of the National Academy of Sciences and authors w widely cited in scientific papers so you have all these bright Minds creating algorithms or a list of instructions to decide when to buy and sell stock with technology you probably don't have access to and actually make a lot of money and the data shows this as well we can see all these three players we have fpis 81% of them use algorithms proprietary Traders 55% use some kind of algorithm and then we have individuals where only 133% of them use algorithms now what's interesting 96 to 97% would generate it through an algorithmic Source basically you're saying most of the profit in fno is generated through an algorithm and these algorithms most of them are used by Foreign portfolio investors you're like an ant who's going into the ocean and saying that you know I'll kill the whale I mean you don't even know what a whale looks like don't you think the odds are really against you if you're trading based on a telegram group or you just feel like the market will go up because you know you drew a pattern on a chart but wait there is some good news there are certain traders who are individuals not using algorithms who are probably making money right I mean it can't be no one I have that data as well and it says 1% of individual fno traders made a profit of 1 lakh rupees or more after after accounting for the transaction costs because the transaction costs actually amount to a lot if the best of the best out of all of these traders in fno the top 1% is earning 1 lakh rups is it even worth your time for it to be pursued the stock market is a net positive game which means that people and value actually increases as more participation happens but for long-term equity but when we talk about something like fno that's a completely different game fno is a zero sum game where someone has to lose money for someone else to make money which means when you are trading you're basically saying these guys who have algorithms and all these smart people working for them you will take money off the table from them and transfer it to you the chances of that is a little low which means that the odds of you investing really longterm and making wealth is much much higher forget about options here are the real two options on one side you have low probability and the stats prove it your stress proves it that this is really hard to do and on the other side we have Equity as an asset class which is outperformed over the long term for a really long time but the tough thing here is it just requires a lot of patience this is the real option the real choice you need to make right now do you select the red pill or the blue pill",

    "transcript_full": "I was scrolling on the internet and this is what I found. [Music] And this isn't the only post. People compare their salaries to their friends and their colleagues only to realize that they are poorer than them. But why does this happen? And more importantly, what can you do to grow your wealth 10x from where it is right now? I obviously have a formula for this. Can I get a pen? Where's the pen? So, let's start there. But before we start filling these variables out, you must first understand why the hell do you even compare yourself to friends? It actually starts with this. Give me, let me show you. It's a school over here. So, all right. So, that's me right there. Really happy. And I didn't care much about the world because I had friends and all these people I went to school with. I went to school with Koreans. Koreans are good at everything. Like, they're all really good. They're all really smart. This guy was actually really good at math. But let's take Narissa for an instance. Nerissa used to play the violin after school. I think she also played the keyboard. She was great at English. Her math was fantastic. She got great mathematics. She was also a prefect and she was highly irritating individual. How can someone be good at everything? And I'm sure you have a Narissa in your life as well. I absolutely love Narissa. But you know as a child I was really envious that how is she good at everything. We all have Sharma beta in our life and our parents compare ourselves to the best person in that school and say He's good at sport. And you know why that happens? There is an evolutionary biological reason for this. So imagine two kinds of humans 100,000 years ago. Take a look at this. So you have population one and then you have population two. These are populations, remember? So multiple people are over here. If you look at this, you'll see these people actually cooperate really well and these people don't. Now, one thing over here is that these people have hierarchy. I'll name this H. So, they believe that there is someone who is the leader and someone who's not. And this population also believes in assessing risk. The person who has the most tools or the best tools over here won't be killed. In fact, other people will try to form an alliance with them. And over here comparison actually caused your survival because early humans when they compared themselves to one another and saw that this person has leverage maybe social connection maybe some form of money maybe some form of skill maybe some form of possession that no one else has that you also need to get. If you don't have access to that as a friend or acquiring it you could literally die. But now that's not true. I mean in the real world our old operating system in our mind is working and running this ancient software in 2025. Today if someone has something better than you, you won't die but your brain and body still lives in the cave. So it thinks that it may back to the whiteboard over here because everyone cooperated. They actually survived which is why they had more kids who also believed in these things. They also had more kids who also believed in more things. over here people didn't believe that and this population slowly perished. Therefore, comparison was survival and all our ancestors were freaking anxious all the time. And it's actually a survival trait. It's not something random, which is why you compare, your parents compare. It's embedded inside our blood. And the solution is needed because think about what anxiety is. Anxiety is about thinking about the future, something that's not in your control. And regret is trying to control or imagine a different series of events that happened in your past. Something like this. The human brain for survival reasons thinks about the future. And worrying about the future creates an anxiety. And that's right, you over here. And then you have the past where you think about the past. And this creates future anxiety, past regret. The solution to this is something over here and I call it the GJ. If you can guess what this is, cuz I'm obviously going to give it to you in the end. My point is very simple. When you start social comparison, you get all these problems and it's ingrained in you. That's why when you graduated from college, you started comparing yourself to all your friends, the money they have, the possessions they have and what you don't have. Suddenly your parents were not talking about Sharmik beta. You were obsessed about who is the Sharma beta that I have to compare to and become miserable. And you know what makes it worse? The internet. Take a look at uh this video right here. I would suggest you take one freaking dollar, $1, buy some bitcoins, put in a goddamn wallet. This video is crazy because he's asking someone to buy $1 worth of Bitcoin. But Bitcoin is worth a lot, right? But take a look at this. This video is 12 years ago, May 9th, 2013. It's about 4 days after my birthday. What the hell was I doing? Why didn't I watch this video? But that's exactly what YouTube was commenting. Take a look at these comments. This guy's rich now. Why am I 7 years late? Why wasn't I recommended by 8 years ago? But there was this one really funny comment which said, \"I wish this was told to me earlier because the YouTube algorithm has now costed me millions.\" So the point is this is called regret where you look at the past and you regret. Notice this video is really old. Then Bitcoin went up after many years. Then people started regretting. There's no point in doing this. So many people made so many predictions. Don't do that. And the problem with modern life is that it compares the best bits of someone else because they're highly curated on the internet with the worst bits of you. You're sitting in your pajama going through someone and saying everyone's life is so amazing because everyone uploads just their highlights and it makes you feel miserable. I mean take a look at this right here. This is an actual consumer research close friends the enemy online social networks and self-esteem. It basically talks about how there are higher levels of credit card debt for people who are highly social on the internet. So basically what I'm trying to say is um so you have to learn to be homo free and like I mentioned I have something for you right at the end of the episode which you can use every day and actually become homoree. I've done it. We make everyone in the office do it and it actually works. But before I show you this second variable right here, I've got to show you something even more interesting. [Music] It's this So look at this carefully, right? So this is a report by Bloom and it's really nice. You'll see here that the rising share of premium and executive segment motorcycles. Now notice these are economy or cheaper bikes which is actually going down and then the mid and higher tier ones are actually going up. So you can see that this is decreasing and this is actually increasing. This basically means people are spending more on expensive bikes as compared to the economical one which means people are spending on status and luxury items because well it gives better value maybe and you look great but you know like owning status symbols keeps changing like hundreds of years ago I think there's a story that a tulip was status then you had owning livestock or a cow was status things right now owning a car or even a German-made car is status. It keeps changing with time. And the key here is that it must be scarse. If everyone has it, then the KTM bike or that expensive bike suddenly becomes I didn't see it. The newspaper said it. I didn't say it. And then I have some other data over here as well. Look at this. So, as you can guess, this is phones. And we can see that low-end phones are actually contracting by growth. And these premium ones are actually growing 55% growth which brings me to which is I mean need you buy something because you actually need it and not because you're looking good because of it then that purchase makes sense. But where are people getting the money for this? I actually have it in the same report here. So, [Music] okay, here it is. All right, this is driven by a share of increasing consumer loans in the credit market. If you look at this, you'll see that consumers are actually taking more loans. It used to be 21% right here, and now it's actually grown to 34%. And this is because BNPL we have credit cards. We have so many forms of credit with just a few taps, a little bit of KYC. You can now access a loan. And that's why when people want to buy a want thing, they can just easily do it. So there was one thing over here. Found it. This one's interesting. It's uh You want to come here closer? the Indian household debt as percentage of GDP household as opposed to the GDP of the country. You can see this has increased a lot from 33% to 42.9% at an India level which means households now owe more. You know the savings rate is only part of the entire picture. Another is just access to loans and I'll show it to you here um right here. Okay, this shows something called STPL which is small ticket personal loans. When it's easy to get a loan, more people take it. And here's the data to prove it. Here you can see that the value of personal loans origination has increased. So more requests. Over here you can see the number of loans have gone up. The number has gone up. Here you can see that a large portion is small loans under 1 lak rupees. And over here you can see that the size of the loan has gone from this massive 2.4 lakhs to 65,000. And all of this is being fueled by NVFC a large portion which includes fintex not banks. And then you have stuff like this. NP is going up which means people who took the loans could not pay it which means too many people are taking loans who are not credit worthy. And this brings us to the next part of the variable of the equation which is here's a simple way to do this. When you buy something you think plus I own this new thing. Don't think like that. think minus now my net worth has gone down because I have a loan but now I have the most important part of this entire equation and actually I've been waiting to talk about this what if the real purpose of your life is to discover who you are and remove fear and I'm talking about these four things right here first I'm going to say money because you don't have money there's so many unfulfilled desires that you may not have next is time. You're not really in control of your time. Someone tells you what to do. Someone tells you when to do it. And you're always completing someone else's to-do list. Then there is physical. That's a dumble, by the way. Uh that's physical part of your life. Are you really in control of your body? You know, in my 20s, I never thought I could have knee pain and other things that old people do. I'm just 36. And that's when I understood your gut, your your body actually affects your mental mood. Actually, that's a good point as well. Your mental health, we can talk about that. And let's call it peace. I think this is the global symbol of peace. And I mean mental peace. And finally, friends, I think there was this Netflix documentary where people started going to blue zones to understand how the hell do people in these areas live 100 or more. And a large part of it was actually having friends around you cuz it brings meaning and it brings you purpose. Look at this. What if you had all the money in the world but none of this? What if had all the time in the world but none of this? What if you had a physical health but none of the other things? The problem is you spend 99 or 90% of your time worrying about just one thing, money, and you ignore everything else. Real wealth is having almost everything, thinking about everything and trying to acquire all these things in just the right amount. Now for that exercise I wanted you to do. Basically go to the description and click on this and you'll find this document. The document will basically bring you to your present. Remember we talked about the future that brings anxiety that you keep thinking about and the past you keep thinking about bringing you regret. What you need to do is center yourself and bring yourself to the present. Once you bring yourself to the present, you will actually enjoy life a little more. I try to write about the things I'm thankful for but take completely for granted. One exercise, for example, is thinking about stuff that you really wanted five maybe 10 years ago and you take completely for granted today. Even if it's something as simple as ordering a donut and getting it at home very quickly and eating it. However, we have the final part yet to be revealed. And this is the variable. And that's how you get to 10x wealth. But if you want a little more, don't forget to smile.",

    "transcript_full": "[Music] [Music] [Music] You know, money is really personal. Everyone's story and biases develop when we are children. And Morgan explains this really well. Like, my parents really want to buy land and a home, but I really like stock. So, we're all a compulsion of our biases. So, I have a money DNA quiz for you. All you need to do, go to the description, fill it up, and you'll get your score. Pause the video right now. Do it. Basis this, you'll understand what kind of a person and what kind of biases you have. Now, based on these results, you're either a compounding camel, a tail tiger, or a buffer bear. It's really important to know what kind of person you are. For example, a compounding camel wants his money to just compound. He believes in consistency, etc., and is usually disciplined. A tail tiger is just waiting for like u the markets to fall and then to buy. You don't really get that scared or panicked when something extreme like that happens. So you're more like a sniper. And then you have the buffer bear. This person does not want to take risk. They actually want to um make sure that in any scenario they're okay and they're not fearful. Now there is no right or wrong over here. They're all different personalities. But you don't want to know that you're a buffer bear and then act like a tail tiger. That is called cognitive dissonance. This happens a lot, right? Like when we are anxious about work and we go to work and pretend that we are fine and then a stress comes, we just lose it. You don't want to be in that. You want to align what you're feeling inside from what you're actually doing outside. Actually, this book uh [Music] sapiens explains this pretty well. Humans are where we are today because of how we can cooperate at scale. You should definitely read this book if you're interested in evolutionary biology and a lot of Carl Sean books also talk about this. But basically, hierarchy signaling is how we survived. Our brain is actually running on this prehistoric software in this 2025 modern world. So even if status does not mean survival, your brain interprets it like that. So even if you don't need this, you still spend 10 years of cash on it. Found this interesting stuff. People spend before the age of 35. Tell me if this applies to you or not. So weddings the average middle-class wedding is between 20 to 30 lakhs. Upgrading gadgets flagship every 2 years 2 to three lakhs. Big city status rent premium 4 to 6 lakhs. Conspicuous luxury goods another 20,000 to 40,000. Festival family functions 10,000 30,000. I understand India has many stratas, different cities, different spends. But overall we are spending on stuff we might not really need. They're not essential. But if you look at this Excel sheet here, you'll basically notice expense category and spent on status. And if you can actually write this, and I'm calling this a packy calculator as in public approval cost index stuff you pay for public approval, but never realized that you did that. So, how much did you spend on these things? Total status spends. And how much did you spend on investment classes? You'll notice you're spending a lot on status stuff. And the cool thing about the Excel sheet is that it gives you a score and it tells you the range. So green is approval, yellow is think twice, and red is uh you want external approval addiction. Anyway, this public approval khaki thing is inspired by the book's lesson on what's it called? Man in the car paradox, which basically says if you drive a freaking cool car and everyone's looking at you, no one is looking at you. They're looking at the car and imagining themselves in the car. So, you think you're getting approval from these guys because they think you're cool. No, they don't. They're not looking at you. They're looking at the car. Most of the amazing things in life actually come to this picture right here. Let me draw it for you. This is the bell curve. This is stuff that'll happen most probable. It's also the safest cuz it happens the most. This right over here, right? This is the tail. This is risky. People also call it luck. So all the stories you hear on social media everywhere else are basically stories of this. Facebook's founder was one of the youngest billionaires in the world. Bill Gates made so much money you can't even count it. Warren Buffett has hundreds of billions of dollars. Elon Musk runs all these companies. We all know these stories but we don't know the story of Rita who is actually a single mother somewhere in UP has able to educate three of her children one of which who has gone to a shaher and is working in an IT company while she continues to cut grass and live in her own house that she was able to build after 30 years of work. These stories will never reach you because I don't know. But I do know that this one is far more inspiring than all these other stories we hear because those stories about Elon and everyone else are this the tales. And this is what you dream of. And Morgan actually had a fantastic solution to this. Let me explain. Think about how tales actually makes you super biased. Look at the returns of gold just over the last two years. Imagine the amount of people thinking that gold will give this return every year. Think about the returns Nifty gave in this period. Think about the number of people who will think Nifty will give this return forever. Think about the appraisal you got that year which was so good and they expect that they'll get the same appraisal you won't. Tails, guys, tails. A tail doesn't happen if you don't take care of this. What do we call it [Music] flatness? So for a tail event to actually happen, which is this, this is boredom. This is no growth. This is you working every single day without seeing stuff move. This is life. I've said this before. The freedom of life is actually in the monotony of routine. It is the routine that you have to survive to actually see this. This is the spike or the lift. And the spike only happens if you're able to actually survive the flatness. This spike happens [Music] because you now survived and the tail event will happen to you. And here's the proof. Talk to any five people who are over the age of 60. If they're close to you, ask them where did the most of their savings that they have today in terms of asset or cash come from. Most of them will give you one or two events. It could be a land their father or mother purchased that they inherited and then they sold. It could be something completely random that was not in their control. But because they survived all those years and there was no disaster, they were able to see the tail. You can't predict the tail, but if you survive long enough, a tail event might happen in your life. And I think Morgan Hel explained this beautifully in his book. So to experience a tail, the flatness basically means um learn to cover your risk. plan for stuff that won't happen because surviving is [Music] for example at the Burkshshire Hatway shareholder meeting in 2013 Warren Buffett said he owned 400 to 500 stocks in his lifetime and most of his money came from just 10 stocks I mean think of Bill Gates also most of his money came from one stock Microsoft and we can see if you just remove some of the top Birkshshire's investments, his long-term average is just pretty average, which means he's a genius because he was able to find and survive long enough for a tail event to happen. So, luck actually happens. I guess this one's my favorite. I think you'll really appreciate this skill because um no one teaches you this skill but I think uh Morgan taught us this in the book and it looks something like this. This is you and this is a milestone. Let's say this milestone is 50,000 rupees a month. You can change this number. I'll put 50,000 rupees a month. You know what'll happen once you hit this number? The moment you hit it and you have reached this milestone, you'll figure out that this milestone has something you didn't know. Wheels. You have wheels here and this milestone just pushes ahead to a new milestone. You know what the new milestone is? It's one lakh. And then once you reach here, the milestone moves again. The beauty about this milestone is that just before you reach that milestone, it moves ahead. So imagine if you have an absurd number in your head like a tail which is like say 10 cr rupees in my account and let's say it takes you 20 30 years to get there you are saying I choose to be unhappy until I hit that number that f actually I have a different story over here and the solution is actually found in a painting. [Music] Oh my god, I think I broke the painting. But um this painting was made by me in Malaysia a long long time ago. I was sitting in the cafeteria and this teacher said, \"Do you want to learn batic painting? We have a workshop happening over here and you can join.\" I said, \"Sure. What's batic?\" and she said, \"This is already drawn for you, and all you have to do is dip the brush in color and just touch.\" And because the outline's already built, it'll just fill fill it up. So, basically, I did absolutely nothing in this. I just touch touch and this was built because these lines were actually already made. And I didn't have a milestone in my head that once I reach this spot, I will win. I was just really loving the project. It was just a lot of fun. And I kind of think life is like that. You want to find a job where you actually like going on most days. The best job in the world doesn't feel great every day. It feels great overall. And if you feel like your work is a little bit like that bath painting and you're enjoying on most days, then half of the work is done. Psychology of money. And then we said and happiness because not having money or the feeling of not having money makes you feel less. So I have an Excel sheet right here. Here's what you do with it. You have the months on the left, June all the way to May. Then the second column is your net salary. Please put this in. Then you have your first tap to control the flow. That's your fixed needs. You can't not pay this, right? Okay. So you'll put the fixed needs. Then you have tab two which is lifestyle. This is where you put everything else. Then you have actual savings. And the target savings we have put over here is 20%. You can change this number but 20% is a good place to start. And if it goes below 20%, the leak shows up as yes or no. This is the most basic sheet you'll ever find. But trust me, if you keep an eye on expenses, just measuring expenses, measuring a budget, and keeping an eye on controlling it, it can make a huge difference in the difference between your freedom and someone else who loves to spend and show off for his validation.",

    "title_current": "Fixed Deposits hacks for 2023 | De-influencing",
    "transcript_full": "dude FD is not an asset class why would anyone invest in it I mean look at crypto blockchain is the future guys I mean if you can see these returns it's mindblowing or even look at stocks there are multibagger gems waiting to be caught every single day and those penny stocks make all that money but you know some people and I'm talking about my parents other people's parents and a lot of old folks they say stuff like Papa do for H I don't know why parents keep saying FD FD I mean they're better Investments out there maybe they just don't understand it so what we'll do this time we look at the good and the bad of fds the risks the rewards and in true de influencing style we'll see whether it makes sense for us or not but before we do that hit that like hit that subscribe and let's get [Music] started now your fixed deposit might give you a 6% or a 7% or an 8% but where do all of these numbers come from I mean does the back decide how much to give out actually it's connected to something called the repo rate decided by The Reserve Bank of India so just like you might borrow from the bank please don't do that the same way the bank borrows from The Reserve Bank of India the country is Central Bank and the Central Bank decides what rate that is but check out this chart over here this is the repo rate for the last 20 plus years and you'll notice that overall the repo rate has fallen quick thing over here higher the repo rate higher the interest rate you get on your fixed deposit lower the repo rate the lower your interest rate on the fixed deposit now let's bring that chart back up again notice the last few years the repo rate has gone up which means right now fixed deposits are giving a good return so that doesn't makes fixed deposits good or bad it's just the cycle within it but here's something cooler go back in time in the year 2000 and you'll see rep rates were really high and that's when your parents were also growing up learning to be adults and saw fixed deposits are giving great returns so it's not them back then fds were giving fantastic returns which is why that fixed deposits do give great returns it's not them it's just their memory so in summary Point number one is this in a rising interest rate environment fixed deposits actually do pr pretty decently well in a falling interest rate environment fixed deposits don't do relatively well there is a public meeting held by the RBI called the MPC meeting this is where they announce an increase decrease or not change of the interest rates and this gives you an idea of what the cycle will be but don't make the mistake of actually investing in the long term because longterm is best right when you invest in an FD or any instrument you have to look at longterm actually before making this video I found this table here and I found something very interesting you'll find interesting too look at 2 to 3 years interest rate you're actually getting a decent return not bad but now look at plus 5 years or somewhere beyond 3 years the interest rate actually reduces weird right I guess equity and other Investments are different but with fixed deposits 2 to 3 years is what seems ideal so so in summary a fixed deposit is not like say a land purchase or a house purchase or like Equity where you wait for 10 years you actually want a shorter tenure so 2 to 3 years seems more ideal than something longer than that but the problem is PMC Bank remember that small Bank in Maharashtra which actually went bust and all these guys were waiting outside waiting for their money and they didn't get any so how can you trust a fixed deposit to actually put money in what if the bank actually goes bust cuz it actually happened with PMC while we were looking through this we found out that the government through this organization here guarantees up to 5 lakh rupees per account per FD which means up to 5 lakh rupees per Bank per person is insured so if you have 5 lakh rupees in bank number one and 5 lakh rupes in bank number two each of them will be insured up to 5 lakh rupes by this organization which is basically the government and then we found something interesting it's not only the Big Brand Banks which are doing this they're also the small Finance Banks they finance well smaller projects don't have the big brand name but because they need to attract depositors check out this table you can see all these small Finance Banks giving a slightly better interest rate and they're all covered by that insurance scheme by the government for up to 5 lakhs per person per account so as you can see Udan at 8.25% for 1 to 2 years is what they're saying notice here again the longer tenure actually gives a slightly lesser interest rate but despite having that insurance cover like any Financial instrument of course there are risks in this case there is time risk it's possible one of the banks go bankrupt which had your deposit and then there's one year twoyear of resolution and legalities to take care of before you get that insurance money back so you lose that one or two years completely but there is one serious problem what if you've invested money in a fixed deposit of 3 years and there's an Apple event and you love that new iPhone how will you have the money to buy it I have a solution simply divide your money into three parts invest each part into different maturities different tenures so you can make a one-ear FD a 2-year FD and a 3-year FD now every year one of the fds will mature and you'll get money you can use this money to hopefully reinvest but you can buy that stuff as well or if interest rates are going up and you want to reinvest you can reinvest in an FD which will give you a higher interest rate this is actually called lading it's done with bonds as well you can do it with fixed deposits too so I guess we figured it out guys it's not the FD it's the interest rate it's our parents memory it's that entire context so I guess now we'll become millionaires sir what about multi are sir credit card pleas H there a good topic ideas how about we do this in the next episode right right if you like this series please put a like please say something nice in the comments if you liked it and hit that subscribe button see you in the next video p shot shot will shot",

not even heard of this are sir you don't worry all these colleges are best colleges we have selected them you just select one of them and think about going abroad earning in dollars Society respect but no no no there's something definitely wrong with that pitch I mean think about it there are millions of students which go abroad every single year but there are a lot of scammy agents and these scammy agents are scamming parents and children off their money so we thought why don't we de influence this entire business we'll also give you a checklist so you don't get caught in the scam we'll talk about the good the bad cuz certainly no one else [Music] will so when you're planning to go abroad and study there are a lot of processes involved in fact you actually do need an agent I have a list here you need Market insights follow-ups in time management your eligibility in short listing there's references there's editorial services like letter of recommendations the CV the application there countless documentations even stuff about Visa firing in scholarship so the correct guidance is actually needed the right agents will guide you to the entire process recommend where you should stay what kind of colleges advantages and disadvantages of both tell you how the application should work so your reje rate reduces just a little bit think of them as the actual Lighthouse guide in this seawave of expectations to get you to your Island that's your foreign college so like I said the problem is with fake agents by the way if you've seen more than one de influencing episode write down in the comments de influencing Army let me show you some scams that we found so over here we can see fake education Consultants were sent to jail because they duped poor students over here we can see that 700 students were scammed who were already studying in Canada we can also see that New Zealand actually deports 150 students for fraud I'm pretty sure a student would not commit a fraud someone told them that that's the right way to do it so that's why we thought we'll make an entire episode about it first we'll talk about all the frauds that actually happened so it can help you identify this so if you have a younger cousin send this to them right now after this we'll also make a checklist to make sure that you can find out whether your agent is good or well uh dubious the first sign you'll see of a fake agent is he'll talk about false representation of the University now this could come in many ways you might see some interesting photos behind where he's meeting interesting people shaking their hands there might be something here saying that he is the only person who has exclusive access to the right people in the college you need to go he may also claim to have setting in different different kinds of colleges and because of this you should go to him now you need to verify whether this guy is actually influential or not in most cases there is a process one for someone to go to a country where the government is involved you can't have any setting there and second to get into a prestigious University which already has a line there can't be a setting there has to be Merit so don't fall for anyone saying and giving these tall claims then we have the fake colleges what yeah fake colleges so think about this on one side you have a desperate student and a really desperate parent to give everything he can to his child because maybe he didn't have something in his childhood God knows why but the agent uses this to his advantage and says here is an offer letter from an actual University here is the website here is the brochure and soon you feel like this is real and he collects a fee don't fall for this how can you actually verify whether the university is real or not you can find them on the website of the official government of that country you don't need to believe everything the agent says I know this sounds difficult to believe and something really obvious but this headline actually talks about an agent Who Sold or rather should I say msold fake colleges and here's something worse the agent can actually show you this a fake degree it looks real right we created this fake degree in the office just to see if it looks legit or not don't fall for this another interesting aspect of this is guaranteed admission the scammy agent will say that he can guarantee an admission in a college but let's just take a step back and think about it an admission is done by an admission committee it's really really tough for one of the countries in the world in a small City in the Gully of the scam agent that you're visiting that he is the one who can actually get one of the students in think about it so anyone saying guaranteed admission be wary next we have the worst of the lot and I'm saying worst because this one really really pinches it's called Visa fraud and a lot of Agents say 100% Visa guaranteed you can't really guarantee the Visa here's the problem the Visa is actually accepted or rejected by the embassy and the only way to guarantee a 100% success rate is to forge some documents misrepresent some information and show things the embassy actually wants to see now the problem is even if you get through the embassy once your child or you are in that foreign country with no one else around you and studying there and when they're factchecking it something goes wrong they will Deport you and you will have to be sent back not only this I'm sure there's some blacklisting process here as well I'm not even sure if you'll be able to go again lying to a government and a university is a serious offense the only way to do this is to actually be honest about what your situation is and obviously not lie then we have the worst of the lot fake job placements you know I was walking around my Society asking this kid why he wants to go abroad and he said he wants to do an MBA in marketing because the salary over there There is almost guaranteed to be $100,000 as soon as he graduates which is about 80 lakh rupees and I asked him do you really like marketing and he said no I like gaming his entire point of going abroad was getting that $100,000 your agent or the scammy agent may use this as a tool he'll say there's a 100% job guarantee you just need to pay an extra amount to me and I will get you placed I'll get you settled I even found a real ad this morning claiming to be the exact same thing the wonderful student and the parent may fall for this remember there is no one in this world who can guarantee a job placement it is only the person in the office who will interview you check you and then get it there is no way to guarantee this except actually go and interview people and then comes the double dipping problem you see all these files over here each each of these files is about a university but as a scammy agent I'll always push you this particular University you know why because I get the most commission from it and these universities may be better but they don't offer a better commission to me and I think this kind of uh misplacing Miss selling is a huge problem because the student is being forced to pick something that may not be good for him and it has a simple to you have to find a university you want to go to it should be your choice I don't think an agent should recommend what university you should go to it is also completely fair for you to write to the university asking them what's your relationship with a particular agent it is your right information transparency fee transparency is your right in this case the agent is trying to make money from you and the university without thinking about well you now let's come to the checklist using this checklist you'll know whether you're agent is scammy or not but for that I need a new file so according to this file here we can see the first thing is academic queries a lot of Agents start talking about the lofty life you live the nice cars the people you know but your agent's job is not to sell that country your agent's job is to tell you what kind of credits your sad GPA what kind of academic qualifications what does the Academic Year look like what it takes to actually study and do well in that University he's supposed to be telling you that he's actually a counselor so if he's not focusing on the academic aspect of your study then something is definitely off second is lofty claims now most people want to go abroad to actually get a job and beyond that actually become a resident of that country so the agent May guarantee or promise that all of his students who went there got a job and got permanent residency resid you'll be able to stay in Canada forever and life set none of this is in the agent control so if anyone says this it's a red flag number three on the checklist is Talking Shop the agent's job is a counselor and a counselor is supposed to listen to what you want find out what it is and guide you on how to get there remember he's like a lighthouse he's not supposed to be talking shop as in how great he is all of his degrees that he's got all of the studen he's got placed etc etc this conversation is not about him it's about you so if there's a scammy agent talking a lot about himself and listening less H that's a red flag the fourth on the checklist are contradictory claims remember a scammy agent is trying to sell you he's not trying to guide you so he may say once you go there you can start earning once you go there you don't need to do any attendance but then whenever lofty claims like this are given you should check on the website on the website of the University it might say 90% attendance required or it might even say students can't work more than x number of hours if there is a major contradiction between what the official website says and what the agent says that's a red flag the fifth on the checklist is keeping you in the dark remember the counselor SL agent is supposed to break down the entire process into steps and inform you of where you are at what stage there can be a lot of transparency here and it will reduce anxiety he's supposed to tell you the process but if the agent just keeps you in the dark and says don't worry B that's just not good and that is a red flag the final red flag is you enjoyed this entire video but didn't hit that like And subscribe so please do that and tell me in the comments your experience about what you think about all of this we've done a bunch of videos on De influencing check them out see you in the next video want to study abroad UK Canada America I will give [Music] you something is [Laughter] [Music] definitely",

    "transcript_full": "[Applause] mommy chai asking for four times a day get a job getting a job government job take good I'll apply [Music] done hello hello praque G I'm speaking from the Indian Railway Department good morning sir morning we looked at your impressive application and uh you've been selected for the job thank you thank you you're being selected in the central Minister's Kota you don't even need to give an interview okay you need to send 5 lakh rupes to our account and after the registration we'll send you the joining letter and the ID card do this promptly right away sir Mommy Mommy job mommy s [Music] [Music] you thank you thank you mommy Joby first day is tomorrow yes where nothing sir today is my first day show me your documents wait wait wait wait show me documents my ID card sir wait wait [Music] wait so this this is my name my no this is fake it's not fake sir this is fake stay here only hold this what it's not fake here leave me let me call the police I have made all the payments I've have gone through the process sir let me call the police don't call the police no sir let me call the police sir please don't call the police sir sir sir man something was obviously wrong with that story and the problem is not with government jobs the problem is the scam that promis people these kinds of jobs and people love government jobs right they are the most aspirational kinds of working people can actually do in the country you will be surprised how often how many people get caught in these frauds so we'll not only talk about the motor soy so you know how this works but we'll also tell you how you can stay safe from it with obviously a checklist we'll talk about the good we'll talk about the bad cuz certainly the fraud star and these guys have no idea so let's get started [Music] so there's nothing wrong with government jobs in fact government jobs are the most aspirational kind of jobs in the country the problem is with scamsters scamsters are trying to dup you off your money pretending to give you a government job and if you don't believe me check this out the Mastermind of the country's biggest ever job was arrested in aligar and it's estimated over 50,000 people were duped and this is not a one-off thing if you went to Google clicked on news typed government job scams you'll get all of these results but why are there so many government job scams Well India loves government jobs a government job has all these perks different jobs get different things but mostly the perks far outweigh the salary and there's of course the job security you get to work in a place for a really long time without the fear of losing your job like any private Enterprise then there's of course the status everyone in Mahala will know that you have a government job everyone thinks that now life and finally every bachelor/bachelorette who has a government job can now get married because like I said they're set for life then there is the aspirational value of government jobs now don't put yourself in these shoes think about a person from a village is trying to get a job in the big bad sheah and for him he's not going to get a job sipping coffee in front of a laptop in a nice air conditioned office he is looking for a job there'll be manual labor long hours and English how will he actually get that nice private job compare that to a government job he's completely eligible gets job security for life the salary is decent and there is status everyone in the village will say wow he is working at a high post he's changing the country so the aspirational value of a government job is extremely high put all these three things together it makes the demand for government jobs extremely high in our country so what's the big deal it's really really tough to crack the interview process and actually get a government job now I know there are lacks of jobs available but in reality over the last few years the number of people appointed in government posts has overall declined if you look at the demand side people trying to get into these jobs only 3% are actually accepted so now think about this the entire nation or a large part of our nation wants to get a government job the number of jobs are in absolute terms is declining it's really really tough to get in and when people try again and again and again and fail they become desperate and this despiration is the fodder for the scamster so let's understand how the scam actually works so once you understand it then hopefully you can stay away from it first you have to apply for the job and you go to a proper website the website you fill up your details the website looks really legitimate and I'm saying really legitimate in fact in one case it was so legitimate that some media houses actually ran a story that XYZ Department in the government is looking for job jobs head on to this website and apply and we can see over here 27,000 people were cheated using a fake government website for over 1 CR rupes that's how professional it looks then the second step is the aptitude test now this could be online or offline where you actually are tested of your grit and skill and knowledge and it feels like you're being put under pressure you're working hard to get that government job and this step two is really crucial because all the people who putting in effort have bought into the process have bought into the scam so it becomes a little easier for the scamster and works as a really good filter of course it feels really legitimate at this point then there Step number three the interview at this point you'll get an email saying we are conducting an interview online come you get dressed wear a tie and you meet the interviewer the interviewer is talking in English them T and it feels like step three I hope I get the job and do the interview it seems like he's putting you under pressure but you know what's worse sometimes not every time sometimes this is not done online and there's a real story there were some engineering graduates tricked by a fake PSU job where the scamster had some connections in some office called them to krishi bavan and conducted an interview inside one of the rooms at this point it feels like I was called to a government office and at this point to get into the job all you have to do is pay a fee now this fee could be anything but in some cases it is up to 10 lakh Rupees and of course after this you'll get the job now at this point you would think everything was done the money was transferred to the scamster and the scam will stop but it actually doesn't stop there to buy the scamster sometime there is a fourth step where he sends you the offer letter which looks like this doesn't that look legit and then also sends you a government ID gives you a joining date so you join on a future date and there are no complaints and if he wants to run away perhaps he can do that in that time then you go to the government office with your brand new government ID and someone looks at it and says this is fake you don't have a job here you've been scammed and I'm not making any of this up if you look at this you can see there was a railway job scam where 28 unemployed youth duped for over 2 and 1 half crores to actually get the job you'll notice over here as per the agency the fraudsters trapped the victims to get a job at the railways if they submitted a certain amount and they finished one month training at Del's train station which means these guys wore official courts went to the railway station and if you read the story they were asked to count the number of containers every single day and they made an actual report they went 1 2 3 4 then wrote that down waited for the next train and repeat it again after after 1 month a railway official came and said I've seen you do this weird thing for the last one month he said sir I work here this is my job he said no brother you been scammed so here's a checklist so you can prevent yourself from getting scammed now I know you won't get scammed because you are watching 01 but your friends or people near you or dadar May so maybe save this for them and help them out first make sure the communication is actually professional if you see a lot of typos bad grammar punctuation marks all over the place something is off i' would also like to add previously we used to have grammar errors now we have chat GPT which means if it's too professional that kind of English is also a Telltale sign that he's used GPT to write something to sound professional if you can have an antenna to make sure to figure out if this is bad English or too much GPT that's your first warning flag second is unfamiliar websites if it's a government job it better be gov.in or nic.in a lot of people instead of putting in and.com do.org because you know it sounds original or it sounds organizational say.org so there's one exception over here if you have a public sector undertaking which obviously has some private money as well those don't end in goov or.in they have their own websites you must find a way to make sure you're gone on their their official website then there is the official Communication channel now how are they communicating with you is it some random guy who sounds really professional on the phone and then whatsapps you shouldn't they be sending an email from an official ID to actually your email box so make sure the official Communication channel is the official Communication channel and not some individual using his private ID to speak with you then there is checking with authorities so the best way to find out whether a job exists or not or is official or not is to First cross check on their official website if you don't find this the next step is to actually call or email the organization directly and ask them whether this job exists or not and then is the biggest red flag of them all charging you to get the job I mean you have the skills you have everything you have to provide your services to the company why should you be paying so if there is an application fee to get in and the payment is a draft to the company that's okay in this case to the government that sounds fine and usually it's not that high but if someone's asking you tens of thousands of rupees or lacks of Rupees to get in that is a huge red flag also if you're thinking you have a jugar to get inside the job and a back door entry think about it in two different ways one it's illegitimate if someone finds out and does an inquiry toil the person asked will also go and the last red flag is when you're talking to someone how do you know this person is legitimate there is a website called IOD where you can go and map which person Works in what government organization with all their contact details I'm sure you have a story where someone tried to scam you or your friend to get into a government job put it in the comments below tell us what other de influencing episodes you'd like us to cover give a shout out to the team cuz we put in a lot of effort in the research storytelling and everything we've done hit that like And subscribe bye [Laughter] sorry I feel better I'm satisfied with my life",

    "transcript_full": "[Music] sir abishek what's wrong with you everything but I have something good busy right I have very good my down time what time downtime that's no time look at this this home okay this is my home I'm buying this home sir this is my home why you buying this home what about the investing we did all these episodes I talked about compounding growth sa the property tax has gone down from 20% to 12.5% it's so simple it's the best time to invest so you're going to invest in property correct it's a long-term investment I'll set it maybe after 10 15 years where will the money come from so I'll stop my sips no the goal so you stop your sips because this will give you a better return I don't think you really understood this budget properly there is one or two things you're completely missing let's begin so question to you what does this House cost 50 laks B G [Music] you actually don't know the cost of acquisition of this house okayy 4 to 7% of this that goes to the state okay then there is registration fees 1% of the entire cost of the house also varies a little bit then there's infrastructure and development cost what cost infrastructure and development cost I buying this so when the society because it's group housing will want to repaint everything build a new Clubhouse add a new my house I'll paint it but you're also part of the society so you will have to contribute to that 20 R per my home so you'll have to either buy the parking space or rent it from someone else because it's also real estate right when you go and see a house you think 50 lakhs is the house that's the cost that's not that's the cost of the house the cost of acquisition is when you add all these other charges to find out what it's actually going to cost cost of House cost of acquisition different Okay cool so let's understand how cost of acquisition works now cost of acquisition is different from the cost of the house the difference is basically this that in a cost of acquisition you'll add all the other charges it costs to well acquire the house so first let's start with the purchase price of the house that's 50 lakh rupees usually people assume this is the cost but it's actually not we're taking a loan over here the 50 lakhs is divided from a 10 lakh down payment and a 40 lakh rupe loan and he'll repay this loan over the next 10 years with interest next he has to pay stamp Duty and this will be about 5% of the purchase price of course this can differ from state to state in this case it'll be 2.5 lakh rupees registration fees of 50,000 Rupees brokerage and legal fees of another 50,000 Rupees now we also need to consider that the house may require some improvements in the future you might want to spend on the house and this is actually called capital expenditure so if you spend 5 lakhs here it means you've improved the house it's important to note that the expenditure on the furniture and Home Decor is not added to the cost of acquisition of the house so let's add all these cost together and the total cost of acquisition of the house is 58.5 lakh rupees please note that this is a simplified calculation of the COA so let's jump back to the episode and see if he's got a grip on what COA is so now you understood cost of acquisition yes go to the description right now pause this video download the sheet make a copy of the sheet and put in all the numbers and tell us what was the original price you thought your dream housee is going to be and actual acquisition cost that will give us a better reality check let's talk about indexation indexation is basically saying if you bought a house for 50 lakhs and inflation went up by 100% I'm oversimplifying over here the cost of this house is not 50 lakhs right now the cost is 25 is no is double is is 1 CR if we sell the house and make some money that is taxed did you actually understand I'm trying to understand it's little confusing right IND meet abishek the owner of this Great Mansion of 50 lakh rupees and obviously this Mansion is abhishek's Strategic investment to make heavy cash in the future he had predicted the completion of this nearby Metro Rail Project and prices went up construction of malls prices went up schools and highways also prices went up and all this increased the demand for the houses so finally after 5 years of enjoying this beautiful Bungalow abishek now feels he is a good time to sell it he was able to sell it for 1 CR rupees yes I mean who else would have been better at investing in real estate than me 100% gains in 5 years even sir could not have done it inflation now it's time to bring him back to reality hi abishek long time no see I'm going to take my share of profit your share that's my share my innocent student actually left with just a g of 10 lakh abishek abishek this is what we call inflation adjustment or indexation indexation another fancy term I have e into your profits which means your 50 lakhs today is not as much as it was worth 5 years ago this is the problem with inflation and the power of your money to buy stuff just reduces so let's help abishek understand the changes in real estate taxes after the new budget let's suppose he bought a house in 2021 22 for 58.5 lakh rupees now basically this is the cost of acquisition and I've already told you how that works and he decides to sell this house now in 2024 25 now we have two scenarios one without indexation that's post budget and one with indexation that's pre-budget 2024 so first let's look at the one without indexation the cost of buying the house stays at 58.5 lakhs no indexation means we don't adjust for inflation so that makes us a profit of the selling price minus the cost price giving us 21.5 lakh rupees this is 2.68 lakh very simply put we bought a house for this much sold it for this much and we paid 12.5% on the profit which is 2.68 LHS now now there is another scenario which used to exist before the budget where you would adjust the cost by inflation let's try to do that so the cost of 58.5 lakhs changes and we add some inflation to it and this inflation comes from the cost inflation index that's right here now if we add it to the cost we assume the cost of the house is now 7.54 lakhs because we've adjusted it to inflation so now the profit is 9.45 lakh which is lower than the first scenario we showed you but the tax rate here is not 12 1 12% it's 20% it's 1.89 lakhs so in this case you can see in scenario 1 that's the new budget we actually paid more tax than was there before now this less tax or more tax is dependent on the value of the CI so this scenario could drastically change over the next 4 years so we don't really know which is better the new budget proposal of the old but you should know how they work at least hey wait apparently a lot of people were not happy with the indexation rule being removed obviously who wants to pay more taxes so now you actually have a choice when you sell your property you could either go with 20% tax with indexation or 12.5% tax without indexation on your G Bangla zamine or any property that you have purchased before 23rd July 2024 but if you purchase any property on or after 23rd July 2024 the tax rule is 12.5% without indexation benefit now let's get back to the episode so what did we learn don't don't just look at the news actually calculate see ke is it good or bad you know don't just read it and decide what to do I have to so now the question is do you want to buy this house or not and this question is for YouTube do you really want to buy this house or not we talked about two things cost of acquisition which you never knew about probably and second is this new indexation thing now if you are buying because the tax has reduced that's not a good reason to buy but if you want to buy a house because you want to live in it it's been your life dream it's an emotional attachment your family can be together of course you should buy just make sure you don't overextend yourself financially Z emotion",

    "transcript_full": "y abishek my index funds have gone down by 10% this is what happened everything else will save you no your gold price is going up de May will get 7% returns it's fine this is everything this is what are you crazy hello look at me I think he you know this time the market will not spare you tissue sir this is not right what happened abishek is shouting at me why is he shouting at you that's not the culture we promote because of you you didn't tell me about gold in depth I think you're too worried about your own portfolio where's that plan for the women 01 channel it's the social plan where I'll show it to you tomorrow it was due last week I'll show it to you tomorrow if you help me with this so we'll talk about Equity gold and debt and how you can balance your portfolio yes now we can talk about asset allocation and how you can divide your Capital to cushion and reduce risk but that will become too complicated yeah correct so um let me show you something simple okay so this is Nifty in 2008 and you all know 2008 crash okay which means Nifty went down all right overall do you think Nifty has gone up yeah so if you invest you'll also make money yeah this is the biggest lie you've been told why because you will not be able to hold on to Nifty for so long you will be scared and certain events will happen du du I will show you another chart over here same time period did the market go up or down remain the same this is gold oh what do you think about gold gold uh is it sa it's safer right compared to equity keep going like so I've heard that usually if Equity is doing well gold is in the opposite direction if Equity Falls gold does well so I think it balances it s we'll do an exercise you guys pause the video write down what do you think of gold safe markets go up gold goes down whatever you think about gold put in those keywords in the comment and hit submit so then we have your thesis and then we look at with you the data we have gold and Equity over here these are the years 2006 all the way to 2024 the blue is Gold return so that's 20% and the Orange is Nifty that's 40% for 2006 and when the bar goes under that's minus so 2008 we can see it's like looks like minus 50% for Nifty you have to see when the orange bar is down is the blue bar up if that is true so over here yes or no no over here no here yes here no no yes so were there a lot of yeses M no which means that they are not inversely correlated so this myth of people saying when gold is is down Equity will go up when Equity is up gold will go down this is not true but according to this gold doesn't fluctuate as much as Nifty why do you think so like if you see here like Nifty is going crazy up and then crazy down whereas like if you look at gold it's been quite consistent rather it's just come down what's the point of investing in gold like if you see here 2006 and 2024 24 is down only I mean it really didn't go anywhere the question is actually really good why should you even consider gold if it doesn't give good returns yeah correct what if I told you I'm going to give you your dream salary and this is to do with risk what's your dream salary dream dream them this is nuts I don't deserve this unrealistic unrealistic oh let's go 5 a month 5 a month let's change this to 7.5 cror a month heck let's change it to 8 cror a month what can you buy in 8 CR a month everything don't answer that how much is 8 cror in 10 months because it's easier to calculate damn it U uh 0 uh yeah 18 no 80 80 okay 80 crores is that a lot of money yeah perfect now let me tell you the job today is your first day at this job you have to go into a Coliseum a what Coliseum I'll fly you to Rome in a Coliseum there'll be you know lacks of people looking at you and W people will come with swords you will also have a sword and it's a death match to the end oh so one of us dies no one person survives but I can die yeah there's six people they have 20 years of experience each doing this and you are a football player would you take this job I won't take it no why because life is more important than it so it is more risky and the risk is so stupid no amount of reward would make sense correct yeah so the same thing is true over here if your money is in the most volatile asset class the chances of you seeing a negative return in a short period of time is very high now you decide are you comfortable with it then fine can I wait till go to go down and then invest in it no you can't time the market I just watch this video where we explain about timing the market you have to get a personal finance adviser who can come understand your situation figure out risk you cannot watch a YouTube video and figured out asset allocation this video will only tell you that asset allocation should happen that's it after that it's a very personal Journey but what we can do is we can plug this in a Excel sheet we'll do this very simply we have only Nifty returns we have this 10,000 rupes invested by the way then there's Nifty plus gold there's Nifty plus Gold Plus debt so over here we can see from 2004 to 2024 money is being invested the returns don't matter we only focusing on the loss when the markets fell down how do you feel so over here you can see the fall or rise what's that minus 31% how do you feel about it bad if you go to Nifty plus gold where you've invested some amount in gold May this is what it looks like what is the fall - 17 interesting right yeah in this case your notional loss was -7% and in just the Nifty case it was - 31% why uh it balanced itself out yeah and basically gold did not fall as much yeah so over here we've invested how much in equity 5,000 and how much in gold 5,000 what is debt debt debt debt is another asset class where basically and I'm oversimplifying this you are giving a loan to a company the company is using that loan to expand its business grow its business and it's giving you a fixed return like a bond yeah like a bond it is a bond oh so you have corporate bonds you have government bonds State bonds Etc and there is an interest rate that you give you called a coupon rate and it's fixed and you have to hold it for a period of time so it could be a 5year bond threeyear Bond 10year Bond like an FD exactly like an FD an FD is also a fixed income asset okay but that's with the bank all right so uh over here now what you can do is you can change this now are you okay with losing 177% po potentially no no how much are you okay if the market had fallen 31% zero zero great then take your money and put it on the pillow you have to take some risk what risk are you comfortable with so 10 yeah so that means that uh how would you change this 5,000 Equity 5,000 gold what would you do oh should I make this 6,000 okay and then Equity will become 4,000 yeah yeah perfect so now once you changed that this now become 14% is that better better better now let's see the gains so Nifty then goes up 60% the next year nice what happens to your portfolio where you changed it it's now only 23% up not 60% up damn how does that make you feel worse so what do you want to do do you want to increase Nifty a little bit yes okay go ahead oh I can do 6,4 6,000 why why you Chang this just now you didn't want to lose 14 but then I gained way more so oh okay now you make 33% but last year you would have lost 20% in this asset allocation but I gain more next year is it okay sounds okay the same thing is available in Nifty plus Gold Plus debt you can change these numbers and come to an amount we've assumed fixed deposit as your debt and we calling it 6.5% so what did you learn from this that I show should also invest in gold and debt because so that I can secure my returns or gains and like uh balance them out uh so Equity we know we can just get it through like a broking app or whatever gold also I can just like go and type gold and get it so on any broking app you can actually see this this is an exchange traded fund so it's a fund but it's traded on the exchange and you can buy it using a broking app ETF can be silver can be old there are multiple kinds of ETFs but you have to look for stuff like liquidity Etc I just understood all of this what is this now liquidity in like how do I select an ETF what is this it's not simple they can vote you tell us what you want what do you like what do you not like about this video and if you want to know more about ETF maybe we can make a dedicated video on it",

    "transcript_full": "investors we are on the brink of a revolution and I need you to invest in our IPO we have created a super high-tech sock location GPS system wow to find that one sock which always goes missing oh think about it there are 7 billion people on Earth and 14 billion socks Market Market size is huge so want to [Music] invest okay something was definitely wrong with that founder I mean recently everyone's talking about IPOs and most specifically IPOs because they're giving crazy returns I mean look at the SN index it's up a lot and we wanted to do this episode because a Yamaha showroom with eight employees wanted to raise 12 crores but got bids worth thousands of crores in this episode we're going to talk about the risks and problems ofme IPOs we're going to talk about the good and the bad cuz clearly the Internet isn't telling you anything let's begin so let's start by explaining what arees smmes are small and medium Enterprises or companies with less than 250 CR turnover and IPOs are wellme IPOs and these are different from mainboard IPOs mainboard IPOs manone the main IPOs you hear about like Reliance or infosis or Ola electric they're all part of the main board IPO and the IPO board is different so how are IPOs different from main board IPOs so SM IPOs are listed on a different kind of board which is the nsse emerge and the bcme this is different from the normal IPO board can you guess why well first it's not a really big business so the resources are less so their needs are different so therefore the regulations are also slightly different for companies for example the mainboard IPOs after they're listed have to release their financials every quarter but not for an company they release it once every 6 months the other thing is that listed companies don't have to give as many disclosures and details like the mainboard companies because they have less resources they're a smaller company you might never really understand their business model their cxos who they are Etc so the information compared to larger companies disclosed publicly is lesser and that's the problem investors don't go to people's factories don't talk to the CEO don't understand the team all they really can go by is data and if they don't have data how will they decide on what company to invest especially if it's the retail people like you and me right we don't have so much of resources to figure out if a company is good or not and if you don't have enough data your decisions wouldn't be as well informed as it would be for a larger company so why have some IPOs really blown out of proportion the reasons are obvious but will shock you because it shocked me when I saw the numbers one after covid there was so many dmat accounts that opened so generally after any IPO number number of participants increased and it obviously increased for the IPO section as well in fact in fy20 the average of just 48 individuals applied to each IPO that's the average but the average now has soar to 2 lakh 19,000 people per offering so the number of people applying has increased the second reason is exponential returns let me show you a chart over here this chart is is the definition of a hockey stick curve look at that thingo these are the returns of the IPO index look at that and we all know how the market Works demand Supply no greed it works on Greed anyway let's continue this index was launched in 2016 it had a value of 1,000 points now if you look at the chart in 2024 it's 16,000 points just think about it 1,000 points it's gone to 16,000 points in just a few years it means in The Last 5 Years the cagr is 60% and this is Nifty giving 12% C what what is this guys I'm being sarcastic of course it's more risky to invest in something that has shot up a lot and obviously it does not make sense for you to do it and I know de influencing Army understands that the third reason is a bigger investment opportunity and to be honest this is actually skewed and flawed thinking in a normal IPO when you apply you can invest between 10 and 15,000 rupees but in an IPO it is 1 lakh rupees minimum now I actually didn't know this until we actually researched and understood that it's 1 lakh rupees per person which is pretty high and my guess is this rule exists so that larger institutions invest and less retail investors invest but it seems like so the retail investor thinks I'll invest 1 lakh it'll go up 50% I'll make 1.5 lakhs even if that's true there is another problem liquidity liquidity defines the number of buyers and sellers if you have many buyers and sellers it's easy to buy and sell the stock if you have less it is hard to buy and sell the stock in SM IPOs liquidity is mostly an issue and you also have to buy and sell in Lots let me explain if you look at this over here you can't just buy one or two shares you actually have to buy the minimum lot which is the minimum amount of shares in this case 1,200 shares it's really difficult to do that because not many people will make a buying and selling decision at the price you want so you get bad prices so let me take an example of resourceful automobiles if you've heard of this good God they had I think a 400x over subscribed market and every anyone thought this stock is crazy they have a lot size of 1,200 shares this is a great example because if you look at the screenshot you'll see that day one and day two graph after listing it's okay liquid not a problem but on day three the liquidity is almost gone look at it but on day five there were only 6,000 shares traded which basically means maybe like five people but didn't they have like what 4,800 crores over subscription P log what why and we found this interesting Reddit thread over here as well learned the hard way bought anme listing down 50,000 of my investment how do I recover someone said wait 10 years someone said what was your theory and he replied the GMP was 120% with over subscription because of the over subscription I expected it to rise but this liquidity issue is not just with one one it's with multiple so if you actually go to the NSE emerge website you'll see out of 371 companies 48 companies the price has not even moved it's not moved that means there is no activity there's no trading now does this make companies bad no it just makes them IL liquid and can you make money from companies of course but you must understand the darker side as well once you can manage risk the upside can be decent now a lot of people say small cap are very similar to small cap small cap no they're different let me pick a stock from small cap which is prage Industries you've probably not heard of them over here you can see that prage even on a bad day has 46,000 shares traded in the last one month so think about it the liquidity there in a small cap company is still larger relative to an company these are two different kinds of companies with different market caps and different liquidity so don't think small cap is equal to they are different and now I want to talk about some sey warnings so because the regulation is relatively little less in IPOs companies the chances of fraud increases just a little bit now chances of fraud could happen in any kind of company inmes it's slightly higher because the risk is higher like recently sebi banned a company because they misused the IPO proceedings and well what can I say it was banned this is to you guys out there who are putting a large portion of your investment cash in just a really small company and this goes for small cap midcap large cap you shouldn't invest everything in just one place right unless you're a founder and have put all your money inside that one company and waiting for that company to grow that's why seie has brought some regulations one of them is limiting the maximum listing day gain to 90% so the volatility is a little less sebbi even said that some promoters may be artificially inflating prices remember this can only be done in low liquid stocks that's why sebi introduced a new rule if an company wants to list in the last 3 years at least 2 years should be positive cash flow sometimes the problem is none of the things I've explained sometimes the problem is just pure greed some people have listed smme IPOs without explaining the business model properly anywhere and just because there's an over subscription investors out of greed just buy it you promise me you'll never buy any IPO main board orme just because it's over subscribed you buy an IPO because you believe in the company I think you should think that you're going to own this company for the next 10 years and if you can't do that research probably don't invest in IPOs that's probably a better way to think about it so in conclusion if r rules around IPOs Titans all these volatile gains will vanish two IPOs do well when there's a bull run when everyone wants to invest so once the Bull Run is over all this news about IPO gains will just vanish and third the only reason you should invest in an IPO is because of its fundamentals and you want to own it for the next 10 years not gray Market premium not listing day not over subscription not anything else if you want to know about that we've created did a special video just around those terms and explaining what they are so check it out if you have invested in any ipu or normal ipu and found something interesting tell us the story in the comments so we can learn from each other say the influencing Army in the comments and see you in the next episode",

    "transcript_full": "sir here's my portfolio long-term planning done invested in Index Fund risk management done diversification done I think you should also take a break wait wait wait wait you think you're over smart I see something you don't what there's a problem in how you've Diversified I'll Be A Millionaire you could have made one check here and saved 10 lakhs at least and I can see this mistake you should not have sit down right here and get ready for a lesson I'll rank all of your mistakes from 1 to five starting with the easiest mistake and going to the worst mistake so you really feel how bad you've got it and you're actually not that smart let's start with the first mistake I can't believe you did this you invested in what crypto Krypto sir you said diversify K I did outside Equity it's diversification I'm not wrong you said me this is right research yes what did you research it's a good coin onchain analysis you did what about the white paper what's the team behind this the what problem is this crypto trying to solve n so basically I saw a tweet from Elon Musk he said Dogecoin will go up so I bought it he's Elon sir so if he's saying it uh this must be right correct okay tell me one thing look at all these three charts okay one huh two and three what would you do with these well they are in uptrend so if I would have invested there I would be a million at that point and look at this it's going to go higher now going going going yes correct oh that's that's cor and it's made all of this money you know what's common in all of them everyone saw the market go up and because it went up they bought and just like you because it's going up they bought and became really really poor look at this crash over here that's the Tulip Mania you know when people actually bought tulips because they thought it has a lot of value you also have the nft crash where people thought these digital things on the internet nfts would make a lot of money maybe there's a future there but the market did crash and now you're getting something similar in a lot of crypto maybe bitcoin's okay but my point is if you don't understand the instrument you can't but I did my research no okay what should I do you should exit but sir the Bitcoin is in uptrend right now now should I exit maybe not if you still want to invest in it because it's finally your choice give it a 2% 3% 4% allocation not so much you've given what 4% that's your call but this crypto thing is actually the most common thing I've seen the most common mistake so it's okay okay the other mistakes are unforgivable they are not that deadly the fifth one is but let's move on to the second one and that's diversification ah correct I yes yes what have you invested in uh mutual fund which ones large gap tell me the names of the funds nepon India large C fund IC potential Blue Chip fund HDFC top 100 fund large C can you tell me what stocks they've invested in uh I'll take some time HDFC Bank Reliance industry and what about the second fund HDFC Bank IC IC HDFC TC basically what you've done is you've invested in three four funds I think and they've all invested in the same companies so basically investing in those five companies through these three four mutual funds there's an overlap it's actually not Diversified why this is what diversification looks like which is midcap mest small cap mest large cap mest correct oh simpler right but this is not as obvious as the next one this is also a little obvious it is right and we have problem number three which is you've invested everything in equity uhuh plus crypto bpto mutual fund basically here's the problem when a covid like situation happens you know when the market fell when in Co yes yes how much did the market Fall very much 33 34% correct which means your 1 lakh portfolio became 33% less valuable after that fall you don't want to put all your money inside just one asset you also want to include another asset like gold or real estate I mean I know so example if you had added a little more gold to it so let's say 10 lakh Rupees in equity and the market Falls 34% how much do you lose very much 3.4 lakhs that is how much you would have lost in covid but let's say you've Diversified your portfolio in the ratio of 70% Equity that's 7 lakh rupes and 30% gold that's 3 lakh rupes then the fall actually would would not have been 34% it would have actually been roughly 21% because gold gave you a cushion because it's well Diversified how because gold didn't move much when the market fell to even out so different assets react to different Market situations differently and gold and Equity are actually not correlated they are less correlated to each other basically you want to make sure that you have some gold in your portfolio or other asset classes in your portfolio don't everything in equity okay and the fourth problem is is I can't direct direct versus not direct funds look at this regular funds you invested in regular funds and I've told you to invest in direct funds where the expense ratio is 1% less T get 15 years 1% how much is the difference I'm sure 1% actually makes a huge difference it's see if you need a financial advisor then and maybe investing in a regular fund makes sense but you have me look at this calculator over here what calculator I'm putting all of your money in and we figured out what's the return here 65.8 lakhs oh that's good and look at in 15 years in 15 years and over here look at the return with 1% more 73 lakhs 8 lakhs difference is what that 1% means this also compounds so this 8 lakhs is going to some someone else when you could have actually made it for no damn good reason and we went around at SUV I taught you all these things and you ignore it where is another tissue I'll throw it on your face what should I do invest in a direct plan isn't that simple perfect which brings us to point number five oh the worst mistake the worst mistake and the mistake is IDC W ABCD IDC W versus growth basically dividend versus growth me hear me out so when you invest in a mutual fund any mutual fund has two options the growth option and the dividend option okay now the dividend option is very interesting because all the stocks you've invested in actually give you a dividend every quarter not all but some and this is extra income right and what the mutual fund does is it takes that dividend and sends it to your bank account so it feels like you have regular income coming from this mutual fund ooh got it so let me show you an example here but why is this a mistake I I'll tell you why it's a mistake but if you look at this think money so if I look at the 5 years return of this fund which is ID CW you are making 12.92% cagr okay remember it how much 12.92% the difference is the dividend is being reinvested in the growth option but in the dividend option it is being paid out so the compounding is actually better on this on the growth side because it's being reinvested and you selected the dividend option go right now and check if any of your mutual funds have the dividend option switch to a growth option always so the compounding is better and you know 1% made such a big difference this is like a much larger difference sir I have a question why do they even have an option to invest in dividend fund you know young people like you and me who have age on their side should use the compounding option which is the growth option but maybe your parents have a CPUs and they want to earn something out of it also so they can use the dividend option and that is not bad it works for them for people who are slightly older oh but I'm not done yet I have five more problems on your portfolio five what",

    "title_current": "Budget 2025 explained in 7 minutes",
    "transcript_full": "personal income tax reforms for millions of Indians this budget boil Downs to one simple question no income tax payable up to you pay zero tax up to 12 LHS of income is this even true nirmala sitaram talks about this and everyone's talking about on the internet but there's a problem here if you look at the slabs it shows 5% 10% up to 12 lakh rupees so why is everyone saying zero and how much money will you actually save when you get your next Credit in the new Financial year we'll start with this I have an actual calculator you can use and after this we'll talk about the other things in the budget so let's begin with the salary part so this Excel sheet is divided into two parts on the left we have 2024 and on the right we have 2025 and the point is to understand how much tax you're going to save so let's start with 12 lakh rupes annual income and then I'll change this number to show where when exactly will you pay tax so over here I'll change the annual income to 12 lakhs on both sides remember only the green can be changed and everything else calculates on its own so now will you pay tax on 12 lakh rupees before we get there you have to remove the exemptions which is HRA children's education allowance Etc as you might know this is no longer allowed you can't do these exemptions anymore then you have reimbursements this could be mobile bills meal CP coupons internet that your company reimburses you this is obviously deductible if you have the proof I'll assume this is zero because everyone's company has different policies the net salary obviously now is 12 lakh rupees nothing's changed last year or this year so far then comes standard deduction just like last year you will remove 75,000 standard no matter what your salary is from your net salary you'll remove 75,000 and you come to a number which is your taxable income remember all those savings that you used to do ATC at CCD Etc are no longer applicable so you can't do any of those Investments to save tax anymore so we have a taxable income of 11.25 laks in both cases now now let's see how it's going to get calculated after we apply the tax labs in the previous year you would have paid 71,500 rupees but in 2025 the total tax payable will calculate at 54,600 however you will not pay tax on it basically if you're earning 12.75 lakhs up to that figure you will pay zero tax this is called a rebate and through that rebate this 54,600 will not be paid in fact if I change this 12 lakh annual income to 12 lakh 75,000 the sheet will still show 62,400 but because of the rebate your income tax will be zero now let's talk about what's getting cheaper and what's getting expensive so we have cancer and life-saving drugs which are getting cheaper because of a tax exempt we have lithium ion batteries which are getting cheaper which means if you're buying a phone or an electric car it seems like those costs since they're going down it should Cost You Less if the manufacturer is nice obviously then we have LED TVs which are getting cheaper so I guess more people will be buying LED it's also good for the environment and you have Lea products and critical minerals will also get cheaper on the expensive side like I said we have flat screen TVs getting cheaper knitted Fabrics getting costlier and any plastic product is going to get more expensive so far rental income's tedious threshold was 2.4 lakh rupees this has now been changed to 6 lakh rupees perom so this is also a nice positive then comes Healthcare and remittances you'll be surprised to know India is the cancer capital of the world it's a sad reality that 14 lakh cases come out of India every single year and this is a public health emergency so a few things have been done one cancer and Other life-saving Drugs cost has been reduced because of a tax exempt in the basic custom duty on the other side we have 10,000 more seats in medical education opened up so we can train more medical professionals as you might know India also has a shortage of health care workers the government is basically trying to make Cancer Care more affordable and reduce the number of cancer patients in the country however a lot of this really depends on the delivery mechanism so how does the drug actually reach the remotest area in the country we don't have excellent infrastructure yet for that delivery system and to further support the manufacturing of these drugs the government has obviously made it better for drug manufacturers the Finance Minister has also announced daycare centers for cancer patients in all district hospitals over the next 3 years so what's going to happen after after this announcement two things first think of the government like you handle your credit card they have to manage their expenditure and how much they're earning they're earning from taxes direct like your income tax and indirect from like GST and other taxes they have to make sure that this is higher than what they're spending now India is actually spending more than it's earning the government is overspending by 4.8% which means it's in minus or a deficit this is called a fiscal deficit and the government is trying to reduce this number from - 4.8% to - 4.4% but if it's actually forgone 1 lakh crores in earning Opportunity by increasing the income tax lab to 12 lakhs plus then how does this actually reduce well their bet is on long-term consumption let me explain when people are paying less tax they have more cash in hand and when they have more cash in hand they will spend so you might go buy a new washing machine you might take an Uber to get there you might speak to someone and you might get it financed you might pay interest on it someone might deliver it you might pay him a delivery charge after that you might have to buy new things to clean your clothes etc etc every single purchase has a multiplier effect across the economy basically it stimulates the economy and pushes consumption which means hopefully over the long term the GDP also expands and when that happens as a percentage the fiscal deficit automatically looks lesser because consumption or the GDP has increased this is great because some people will also use that extra money in hand and invest in the markets and hopefully the markets will go up and when I say markets I don't just mean stock markets I mean every Market out there however the problem is that this won't happen in the next few months it'll take some time but when it happens we might look at a nicer India with a higher GDP",

    "title_current": "India America Trade Deal can be a BIG Disaster!",
    "transcript_full": "India very very tough very very tough Trump just declared a trade war they took our businesses they took our money they took our job and this has caused a global market meltdown they do it to us and we do it to them but look at India even the hottest nicest largest stocks are falling like crazy so I want to answer two things one is the market actually going into a recession and we will fall so much that your portfolio will be worse than you think or two the market is actually bottomed out and this is a good time to buy because all these stocks are available at great valuations and I think the answer is in this chart here. If you look at this, this is not the stock market guys. This chart shows that tariffs have been low for a really really long time but now this number has gone up. What does this really mean? This causes two problems. One, the actual price of everyday items goes up. And second, because each country is putting reciprocal tariffs to each other, global trade falls. And because global trade slows down, revenue falls down. Revenue falls down, demand is gone. Demand goes down, they think about future investor growth, they think it's not going to be that high. Because of that, markets fall. Maybe companies stop taking loans and capex expenditure goes down. And so many other things that can happen, a normal YouTube video can never predict. So if the world will slow down because there is world trade slowdown, doesn't it mean that this possibility is possible? That means a recession could actually happen because there's just no growth. But why is America doing this anyway? America is doing it for three reasons. And this is not my theory. This is something that's floating on the internet. So the first thing that happens is that when they're importing with a higher tax, well, they earn more money. That means the deficit decreases. And second, because it is higher tax and it's more expensive, people will prefer a locallymade item versus an imported item. So the amount they import will decrease, further decreasing the deficit. When the overall deficit decreases, it strengthens the economy. The third thing, where will the demand come from? Because demand overall is low. They're saying that US will actually cut interest rates. When people cut interest rates, their buying power increases and therefore all that demand will go to made in America companies. therefore strengthening the base of America and making it do well. But how is all of this connected to your portfolio? Look at your portfolio on one tab and see how horrendous and scary it is. On another tab, open all the news websites. All of them are scaring you and telling you how things have now changed and why this is scary. But I wanted to remove all of this. Let's just look at some data. Okay, very simple. How is India connected to the US? Exports. Correct. Exports. The number we found is roughly $87 billion give or take. $87 billion sounds like a big number just tariff. So of course our country will be affected. But shouldn't we look at this number as opposed to our total exports. Okay. So our total exports are roughly 800 billion. So our total exports are 800 billion. What's being affected is around 87 billion. That's about 10% of our total exports. Is it bad? Yes. Is it so bad that you go into depression and you're scared that your portfolio is going to go to zero? No. Of course, it's bad, but I think the internet exaggerates this a little bit. I'm telling you, it's all right. It's not as bad as the internet is claiming it to be. So, does this mean that you should buy more equity? Hold on. Subar. Let's talk about one more data point. And this data point is actually a story. I want you to imagine this horror story that has happened for the last few decades. The mounting fiscal deficit decline, the balance of payments crisis, the hashed ma scanty, the dotcom bubble, the 2006 market selloff, the global financial crisis, the corona virus. Oh my god, that was actually scary. And now we have this. Every single time this has happened, the markets have gone up. And you can also see the same behavior in this chart right here. Look at the red bars. This is the return of Sensex from 1980 to 2025. Every time the market falls afterwards it bounces back. Is this true just for equity? No. This is true for every single asset class. So even if the market falls another 15 20% it's still okay cuz this is not in our control. But what is is that you are mentally prepared that something like this could happen. My point's very simple. If the market has gone through so many bad things and eventually still done well, no market guru can tell you where the market will go. So, why bother? And why read the news and get scared? But I didn't answer this question, right? What about a recession? What about the market reverses? Here's the answer. Since no one actually knows what's going to happen, let's prepare for exactly both these scenarios right now. So, on this side, we'll talk about what if the market goes through a recession. And that's what Nifty is like 22,000. Let's say it falls all the way to um 15,000. That sounds scary. uh is down 7,000 points, down 31%. What do you do? One, if um the first thing you need to do before you invest any single pennies is make sure you have the emergency fund. So your 1 month expense multiplied by 6 months. This is your nest egg. It's your emergency fund. Put it in a fixed deposit and leave it. This is really important. Then get life and health insurance. Then once you're left with some money, you must start investing. Now, if you're already invested, please, if you can increase your SIP right now, it's great because you'll be thinking about the next 10 years. Markets are falling, you'll get better rupee cost averaging. It's a great time to continue to SIP for as long as you can. That's it. So, every time the market falls, you know you are making a better future because you've got a better price as an entry. And then here we have a markets double in the next few years. The only thing you need to make sure over here is that you don't get greedy. Because as soon as this happens, you'll start buying small stocks that you don't understand and you think you're a genius. But actually, you're not. And neither am I or anyone else on the internet. And you know what? The point of this video is probably nothing. We realize that people look at the news, see the market fall, and get really scared. And your brain right here, your mian brain and your reptilian brain will tell you to react with action, with panic. The fight or flight movement will kick in and you'll be like, but you know the answer is nothing. You don't do anything except these things right here. But you sit and you wait and you're patient and you just enjoy your life. And your portfolio is too small a part of this entire global economy. Think about the next 10 years. Mega sub, can you just go back to your life and enjoy it? If you have any questions, put it in the comments and we'll let you know.",

    "title_current": "I investigated why Indian cities suck (but no one can fix them)",
    "transcript_full": "You know, if you've got to reach office by 10:00 a.m., you got to get up at 7:00, leave by 8:00 in a hurry only to arrive late because this guy actually solved it way back in the 1950s and its effects are still felt today. But before I tell you about that city, we first got to understand why the hell are all Indian cities so badly planned? So let's start with Guram, the millennium city. I have a map over here in the 1980s. Imagine all of this wasn't there. It was purely just agricultural land. And the Hana government basically had a liberal land acquisition policy allowing developers to just buy land from farmers. And the developers said, \"We are going to build a worldclass city as you can see right here. Sorry, wrong map. World class city. Yay. Good girl. And if you look closely, it doesn't look so world class. So, I'll tell you why. I can see like problems here, congestion here, and I'm sure there are a lot of potholes we can't see on the map. Point is cities are like companies which means they need to have everything to make things work. The sewage system, the way the population is distributed, residential areas, sec zones, you have to have forest cover, etc., etc. It's not something maybe developers can do because their incentive is to make a profit. So they won't think of all the infrastructure. They will just build in clumps wherever they think the land acquisition worked. The municipal corporation didn't exist until 2008. Meaning the city was actually built by developers. Which means Gura was a develop first plan later model. If you look in the case of say Gura and businesses are given a little more tabaju than anyone else, they will care more about the profit, less about the citizen, less about the government, less about the sewage system. And a great example is this picture. So what's the solution to all of this? This guy actually had the solution. But before I tell you, I've got to show you something really interesting. So imagine this. We have a new problem here. Here's how building a road generally works. We have a road that has to be built. There is a government tender which goes to subcontractors. Subcontractors above them have a main contractor. The main contractor to get this road actually has to submit bids. These bids I'm going to put dollar and rupee signs. The lowest bid actually wins. Now this is slightly more complex than I'm showing over here but it's optimized to save taxpayer money which means lower the bid the likeliness of them winning is higher which means the weightage of quality is actually less than you expect and that's why you get uh where is it this you see as soon as a contractor wins a tender like this and because the margin is so small now because it's a It's a small bid. And once he's built the road, one monsoon is all it takes. Two overloaded trucks and one guy speeding and you get the potholes. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking that all we need to do is focus on quality. But it's not that simple. We're doing 34 km of highways daily. And if you include normal roads, etc., It's 100 kilometers every single day. How the hell will you monitor quality for so much of road across such a large nation where billions of people stay? In fact, I have a report right here. The auditors unearthed suspected fraudulent practices worth 400 crores in the procurement of bitumen including duplicate fake refinery invoices. So it basically means the greedier the contractor the worse the roads which obviously leads to traffic jams. Let's do a quick calculation of how much money you actually lose. Imagine 1 cr people get stuck in traffic for 1 hour every working day. Let's also assume you lose 200 rupees of productivity in that 1 hour. Simply multiply these two numbers. Look at 200 K rupees lost every day in the country multiplied by all the working days tens of thousands of kores of rupees lost. So if we are losing so much money every year why is nobody solving this problem? I mean just fill the damn potholes. Potholes don't get filled up very quickly because of the British. Sir but I don't agree with you. Why? I I don't agree with that. I mean foot parts B we have foot partaths but the problem is that you can't use them because of u encroachment people are actually walking on the road because there is no place for them to walk here so isn't that interesting we are part of the problem guys and because of this encroachment no matter how much infrastructure we build your four lane in India will always be a one lane in fact in Delhi alone the government has identified 1,700 colonies where people are living illegally. Estimated home of 40 lakh to 50 lakh people. This is because people are using public land for their private benefit. And speaking of encroachment, let's talk about the biggest land encroachment of all done by the Britishers. In 1896, while the British were in India, there was the bubanic plague. But everyone in Bombay was sick and the disease was spreading. So to fix the problem, the Britishers created this new authority called the Bombay Improvement Trust. Now the Bombay Improvement Trust was run by bureaucrats, white people who are not from real India. They don't stay there. They don't live there. But even though they never understood India, they were still appointed to run this trust because Britishers believed Indians were not smart enough to solve their own problems. India inherited the Bombay improvement trust model. All we did was we replaced the word and called it development authority. All development authorities in India are run by bureaucrats. I mean is officers etc. And these people are good at planning. They are super smart but they are not specialists in city planning and design. Now let's look at the contrast. The contrast is your local municipal body. The local municipal body is elected into power which means their incentive is aligned to you to the people living there. Because of their vote they are in power. So if the improvement doesn't happen there is misalignment. So good. So why hasn't the power gone from development authorities to local bodies? Well, it has. Let me read this. In 1992, the government implemented the 74th constitutional amendment act which gave protection and status to urban local governments for urban planning. So now urban local governments had power and responsibility for urban planning. But wait, didn't I just say that development authorities are doing all the planning? Here is the problem and the gray area. So, the state didn't actually transfer the power from the development authorities to the local municipal bodies. So, you know who's in charge now? Both of them. In other words, nobody. When you have two people in charge of something, no one's in charge. In fact, I was going through this one story which says the Gazyabad Development Authority and the Gazabad Nagar Nigam clearly get into very frequent issues where the government says please complete the handover of seven Gazyad colonies in 2 months. But these things don't happen because each party is fighting for control and credit. And because of this confusion, like I said, no one's really in charge. So, how do we solve all of this? And like I said, that guy solved this many, many years ago. But if you can guess what city I'm talking about and put it in the comments before I reveal the city, then I'll give you one like. Look at the city. You have main streets. You have crosses. You have places to walk. You have green areas. You have residential markets in each area. It's very simple to drive through. You have gold chuckers everywhere. When I lived here for a very long time, I realized how easy it was to find every sector and how confusing it was because every sector looked exactly the same. And it's not just cities like Chandigar, it's also Bhneshwar, Indor, Surat and a bunch of other planned cities. And it's almost as if you plan a city, the citizens respond with love and kindness. None of these three players are the main culprit. All three actually have to care about each other and make sure it works for a city to actually be less congested and a little more livable.",

    "title_current": "The Water You Drink is Worse Than You Think",
    "transcript_full": "This guy has no water in his house even after paying 40,000 in rent. But okay, it's just one day, right? Or is it? For lacks of Indians, it's a daily expenditure and a struggle to get even two buckets of water. And for those who can't afford to pay, it's just a tap with time bounds and limited supply. So, in this video, I'll investigate the issue across four different cities. I'll explain how this problem is slowly creeping into your life, into our life, how we're already paying the price, and help you realize it through this cost table. So, let's investigate and let me find out. Let's start with this is the Yamuna flowing right through Delhi and this supplies water to the entire city. Yamuna is the fourth largest river in India and one of the most polluted. It blows my mind that if it's so polluted, how is it supplying? So then the treatment must be right. Now to be honest, the Delhi Jalboard actually has a lot of treatment plants. But let's look at the numbers a little more closely. First, it says we have 37 treatment plants. 14 failed to comply. That means out of 3,600 million L of sewage generated every day, about 2,955 million L is treated. What you have to remember is that about 640 million L a day goes untreated because of capacity or quality issues at the plant level and it drains into you guessed it the Yamuna which is why it's not able to recharge and it's a net negative and it just keeps compounding. It becomes dirtier and dirtier. Forget about drinkable. The Yamuna isn't fit for bathing. And this is the quality level. The there are 19 parameters of samples which are actually failing. Ideally, this should be zero. That's when you know that the river is healthy. No wonder when you go abroad you see fish inside the river or streams inside the city. But in India when I travel from Delhi to Noida I go over this bridge and the Yamuna is passing by and the Yamuna has a lot of jag you know to deal with this around 7% of Delhiites have found their own hack bottled water. It roughly costs 2 to 5 rupees per liter and if one person uses about 4 L a day of drinking cooking that's about 200 to 600 rupees a month just to feel safe about water and those who can't afford this premium they end up paying a special tax called the poverty tax 93% water is piped water in Delhi but we know that you don't get 24-hour supply in many places the supplies is just for a few hours. But now let's think about an unplanned colony, something that's not part of the master plan of the city. So there are no pipes going there. Obviously, it's unplanned and in many cases illegal. The water supply with the pipe does not exist. So the solution becomes these damn tankers. Have you ever seen those water tankers going to do their duty to supply water to some place and there's always water overflowing and the driver knows that the water is leaking and he does absolutely nothing. The water tanker now sells you the same water at around 200 times the cost of Delhi gelboard. So when you depend on tankers, the price jumps from 0.5 pesa per liter to 1.25 per liter. And if one person uses roughly 2,600 L a month for all their daily needs, that tanker bill comes to 3,300 every single month. The problem with water tankers is not just a Delhi problem. This happens in every single metro. Even in Chennai, lacks of people depend on water tankers. But their reason is very different from Delhi's. I Madras study reveals presence of forever chemicals in Chennai lakes and drinking water. Now these are what are called forever chemicals for a reason. They're almost indestructible and linked to serious health risks. But how did they end up in our lakes? Untreated industrial and domestic waste flows straight into them carrying all these chemicals with them. On top of that, toxic liquid from waste dumps has been slowly seeping into the lakes, too, adding even more of these forever chemicals to the water. Think about this for a second. When you have an ARO, which you're spending money on buying the maintenance, and you feel like it's UV protecting and all those features you bought for is giving you pure good drinkable water. It may but because of the presence of forever chemicals that arrow water cannot actually remove all those chemicals because it is not designed to you never think that those forever chemicals exist in that water. Ganga in Kpur, Miti river in Mumbai, Godavi river, Gumi river all of them suffer from some kind of pollution. Now rivers I understand but what I don't understand is rainfall. I think rainfall is going to be the solution to all of our problems including the issues that Mumbai is facing. Well, we all know that this happens once the rain water touches land in Mumbai. Yes, one reason for the streets to look like this is increased rainfall and the 70-year-old drainage system which isn't designed to deal with so much rain. Plus, with the wetlands and mangroves now paired with concrete, this water can only do one thing, right? It can just um flood the streets. Contrast this with something like you'll look over here in Germany. I actually did not know this. In Germany, the engineers have designed the road that literally almost like drinks the water. So thousands of liters or rather 4 tons of rainfall in under a minute is absorbed and goes right into the groundwater recharging it. So the road is good, the water is recharged and everything is nice. But in places like Mumbai when the streets the train tracks look like that it's you who actually pay the price. A cab which normally costs 200 rupees now costs 3 to five times more. And let's say there are 3 days in a month during the monsoon season where you end up taking a cab. You will spend nearly 2,500 rupees. You know all these small expenses add up. And it's not just Mumbai. Bangalore 2 grapples with this issue. Look at this over here. You look at the blue line which shows how much extractable groundwater is possible and the red line which shows how much we are extracting. Look at this Bangalore rural. the red is actually higher that means we're extracting more than what is actually available on the other hand the same thing is true for Bangalore urban we are over extracting what we can from the water table and because of this we're hitting a dead end this will not fix on its own but the solution the cities have is this they'll dig deeper extract the water and the water that does come out is this 600 mg per liter that's the tedious of the water Twice the safe limit. And this problem has actually spawned a new industry, the water softener industry, where you buy something at an industrial level or for your home and these machines look massive in your balcony, don't look pretty either. And while these ones cost upward of 15,000 rupees, let's assume you use these small ones which fit on your shower heads and taps. Now the cost of these is somewhere around 3 to 4,000. Say you get two of them installed in your washroom. It'll cost about 170 rupees a month. And let's not forget the cost of filters which you will have to change every 6 months. So that's also a recurring added expense. You know the problem with us humans is that we only see the next week or the next month. We forget about the second or third order problem of things. Now I live in Nida. Nida has hard water which means the chrome on my car actually become black. The taps blacken very easily. All of these things and fixtures blacken very quickly. Another problem is that you might get skin or hair irritation. So you might go to your dermat. The dermat might give you something else. Maybe someone's skin is very sensitive. You have to buy those lotions. and they always sell you expensive stuff as it should be perhaps. But these are things you probably have no choice but to spend on every year. Because if the water you're consuming isn't good, you'll probably end up spending lacks of rupees in a hospital for something that you don't even know is connected to the quality of the water in your life. I want you to think about it. Medical inflation is going up way more than even Nifty. So it's going to cost more. Your health is the best kind of investment you can make in yourself. So you have to invest about 79,000 rupees in all these things here. The problem isn't it's not like there is no water. The water exists. We saw river source. We saw the rainfall source. The problem is we don't give a We aren't managing the water properly. We have to be looking at actually storing it, using it, caring about this. Actually, people watching this video do not know what I'm talking about. You yourself are not paying 50 times the water fee. You yourself are not seeing dirty water yet.",

    "title_current": "How to Pay Off Your Home Loans FAST?",
    "transcript_full": "you already own a house or want to buy one now to buy this house you're taking a loan of 50 lakh rupees and it's gonna last a while in fact after twenty years you will end up paying 1.04 crores that's double of the loan amount it's actually an interest zindagi but if you did the right things your loan could stop at year eleven and you would end up paying 80 lakhs that's a saving of 24 lakh rupees sir what sir sir sir sir we are shooting what are you doing sir sir i have a home loan and i'm leaving day after tomorrow where are you i'll see honeymoon sir what's honeymoon where are you so sixty days honeymoon sir please help me save 24 lakhs six days honeymoon is not allowed help me save me who approve this shit ma'am if i help you save 24 lakhs you'll cancel this nonsense i'll not cancel conquer the nozzle in ten days done ten days deal so i'm gonna give you four ways to actually achieve this let's start with number one to get this first trick you need to know this table called the loan amortization table now imagine you have a loan amount of 50 lakhs and the interest what's the interest you're paying 8.5 10 this is twenty years right emi comes to 43,391 a month if you add up that emi for two forty months it comes to around 1 crore 4 lakhs now here's where it gets interesting let's suppose you've been paying for ten years now ten years is about one twenty emi you'd think by now you've almost cleared your loan right but not really you've only paid off around 15 lakhs of the actual amount you borrowed the rest has gone in interest means it's gone to the bank so basically for the first half of your loan you're mostly paying the bank you're not paying to own your home as much which is payment towards the principal of your loan sir what should i do yeah good point but you understand how this works now right i gave you a bonus abhi three months ago uh-huh you spent it right no no invest it fd okay fd so you have cash right yes can you get me jenga vlogs quite a lot i'll show you something so there is a new type of account you can open it's called an offset loan account so let's suppose you have your principal this represents 50 lakh rupees $25.25 yeah let's not it really represents i can't say $50.50 okay on top of this you have bank interest okay now if you have now basically if your loan is larger what will happen to the interest right so if you remove this this also remove correct correct understood yes now if you have an account like a offset loan account which is a separate account where is this account you can open it with that bank ask them do you have an offset loan account and offset account loan account holding it so you open that account and you deposit that 5 lakh rupees that he got for the good work he's done here and you deposit it here as cash now bank will not charge interest on this amount usually because it's in that offshore account offshore offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account offset account oh so this results in savings of the emi how much did i save let's see now considering the same 50 lakhs home loan with a normal loan you pay interest on the full amount around 35,000 for the first month but with an offset loan you can park say 5 lakh rupees in a linked account for just two years and the bank charges interest only on 45 lakhs so basically your loan amount is the same but your interest is calculated on a smaller principal so this saves you 93,000 in total and helps you close the loan roughly 10 emis earlier now of course this is just one example actual savings depend on how much you really park for how long the interest rates and it can vary obviously from bank to bank 24 lakhs this is just 93,000 sir you know you will save 24 but did you know this did you know this i did not know this but this is not appreciation for this point please this is very small that's a very bad clap this is very embarrassing okay so let's move to option number two sir pass me that's out 24 lakhs not saved remind us sixty days sorry ten days ten days what you can do is you can transfer this loan to a different bank or ask your existing bank to reduce the rates well my papa don't own the bank sir i can't ask should i show you an example will that save money step one you have all your basic loan details here 50 lakh loan twenty years yes 8.5 yes sir we know are you ready current loan let's suppose ten years have gone by and you've noticed that the rates have fallen for whatever reason interest rate now interest rates okay okay interest rates and now your outstanding balance is 34 lakhs actually 35 lakhs ten years are left current emi is the same 43,000 so when you refinance there are certain costs okay so let's see what happens there's a processing fee of 1% there is which is 34,000 there's legal yeah oh that's one legal charges valuation charges the total refinancing cost is 55,000 almost the point was to save money but okay the new interest rate is seven and a half percent which is lesser than our original now over here you will see that the answer is if you subtract all this and see the savings total interest new interest you save about 1.66 lakh rupees this is refinancing with the same lender if you move to a new lender and they offer you a lower rate of if they offer me a lower rate if yeah this is if rates have fallen from when you took the loan fair okay and in a twenty year loan period this scenario is likely to happen okay so the new rate is 7% and then you have all these details 1% you charge etcetera so we have the new interest and the old interest you subtract it and you have saved almost 3 lakhs so what are the two options where you can actually use this refinancing stuff fixed interest rate correct so if you have a fixed interest rate and rates fall you can refinance at the lower interest rate but there's a second way if you actually improve your credit score and when you initially took your loan your credit score is bad and then it improves you can refinance it because now you'll get a better interest rate i did everything my credit score was a video yes 24 minus 3 lakhs is 21 lakhs remaining yes i mean 3 lakhs is also okay so give me the red market please i don't like you doing this i love you too sir i'm your t this is not working anyway i have a floating interest rate so fixed rate is not working for me anyway so three lakhs so this doesn't count yeah it's okay i always have something interesting to show you which is now point number three here is where we save the big bucks 24 lakh rupees one point only okay yeah this is to what's point number four i'll tell you i'll tell you so now look very carefully remember we saw this together all i'm gonna do is i'm gonna add two new columns the first column is called one extra emi paid this means you pay one extra emi per year out of the twelve months in the sixth month you pay one extra emi that will hardly make any difference now hear me out so i'll change this can you change it to one this is extra emi now yeah done click enter enter and over here you'll see every six months this 43,000 will be added okay here's the beauty this one change of one extra emi saves you almost 10 lakh rupees not almost more than 10 lakh rupees oh and your entire loan is completed within sixteen years and six months so you save time also 10 lakh rupees saved and four years also saved correct just one extra year that's doable right are you sure this is correct yes it is okay i'll tell you now a second technique you see this this is a step up emi may something extra let's suppose it's how much percent 10% okay so 5% 5% is not a lot yeah so i'm gonna add this 5% and now what that's happening and you will notice that you will save a lot of money over here how much money did you save i can't tell you i have to tell you something else you have to tell me no this is part of the this part you want 24 lakhs right 24 lakhs i yep hear me out this is the ladder that success of success and we all have these basic things to keep us in autopilot mode autopilot is you not thinking about life so give me something 12 pass -uh college -job -job -okay marriage -kids -car -car -car -car -ghar i'll just add one more ladder which is 1 crore at pottery you know this ladder is pretty much unlimited the acquisition of wealth and material is the distance between you and unhappiness you will always be unhappy because you will have the compulsion to earn more and this actually never really ends compulsion money compulsion money people watching this youtube video you sitting with me all earn a decent amount and if you don't in some time you will the end game is simple you will end up with good money when you're older for sure it will eventually happen but what if you gave away all of your life because of compulsions like this when i told you to do a 5% step up or i told you to pay one extra emi and you said you are not alone take care of yourself in that case the emi maybe is too expensive so you need to think if you are going up this ladder forever and you lose twenty years of your life a better way to reclaim your life is to do these two things pay off that loan as soon as possible so you can actually do stuff real wealth like actual money can never buy answering your question if you can do an annual step up of 5% and you can pay one extra emi every single year how much money do you save 24 lakh rupees but you are not paying this to reduce your interest you're paying so this loan can go away faster and you can reclaim your life so you better enjoy that first honeymoon hopefully this one happened $24.24 is okay hr to cancel your leave ten days right i told you",

    "title_current": "Why Indian Roads are the deadliest 💀",
    "transcript_full": "This is not an accident. It's actually a planned murder. And I have five pieces of evidence to actually prove it to you. When there's a road accident, 75% of those people involved in the accidents have a license. But that would mean there are loopholes in getting the license. Right? In fact, Shri Nitan Gutkari himself has said that 30% of Indian licenses are fake. It's good the government knows this but they can't stop millions of people doing this. Right? This study in Delhi followed 800 people who have a valid driving license. And you know what they found? The report found that three out of 10 people actually took the test and the rest seven didn't take the test. And you know what? They even did a surprise test from some of these people to figure out whether they understand the road science and six out of 10 people failed. This is interesting. People on the road literally have a death machine in their hands. And if they don't understand how the road, its procedures, its rules work, that sounds like a problem. But the question is why did they fail? So maybe the issue is with the manual process. But you know what? They recently automated the entire driving test protocol and the results are pretty interesting. This is what a normal driving school looks like where they're a bunch of people observing the driver and giving him a pass or a fail. They replace these people with cameras and sensors. So the test became automatic. Previously 80 something% people actually passed. But now after the sensors it's 40ome. That's half. This is called an automation shock. And it's not just Delhi. It's all major cities which have seen this kind of automation shock. 1.75 lakh lives have been lost due to road accidents. That's 20 people every 60 minutes. Let that sink in. I was literally shocked by this number. And it must be because of those damn potholes, right? Or maybe it's the bad weather for a reason. Or then it could also be the trucks, right? No. Then then then what's the cause? If you think about it, it's you, it's me, it's us. Human error. And if you look carefully within human error, what the error actually was, the type is oversp speeded. Over 46,000 lives were lost last year due to oversp speeding. 100% of these deaths could be avoided. Oversp speeding. Which means the person oversp speeding thinks the car is under my control. Yet the person thought if I'm oversp speeding nothing will happen. I will take care of it. I am a good driver. And even if you have insurance, life insurance because the person was driving rashly, the insurer will not pay. This is an order by the Supreme Court and it makes sense because it's an avoidable event and it's not like the system isn't trying to fight against this. The fines exist. If summer over speeds, the fines have even increased almost every few years. But what's your friend solution? Matana. Such matana. He would try to bribe the police. One really good thing that I see in cars nowadays is that it makes the most annoying sound. You know what that is, right? But Indians are very good at jugar. Check this out. These cute death machines were so popular that they appeared in 13,000 listings across the internet. And the center, not state, the center, the government banned those listings. Now if you go on Google and type this, they have reappeared on different websites. Some of them really popular e-commerce websites. You know, A to Z. You know what I'm saying, right? Seat belts. But now let's talk about helmets. Its function is to help your head from cracking in case you crash. But for 99.9% of the audience who's listening to this, they wear the helmet. [Music] You see, when you think that it's not about safety, then you make wrong decisions. 39,000 people have died because they weren't wearing the helmet. This was again completely avoidable. Okay, look, we all know that we should wear a helmet because it ensures safety. But let me tell you a crazy story. So petrol pumps were told by the government that unless the rider is wearing a helmet you won't give petrol but Indians are and what happened was there was a person from the petrol pub who would stand at the entrance and say helmet he'd say no cool wear this helmet get the petrol when you're exiting give me the helmet back the petrol pump is incentivized to break this rule because it has to sell the damn petrol now Let's put all of this together. Driver's license obtained illegally. No seat belt, no helmet, over speeding, straight road. Every time we hack safety with these no use helmets, in some way we move an inch closer to becoming the victim ourselves. Two wheelers are the kinds of vehicles which meet their fate the worst out of all kinds of vehicles. And it makes sense. Most of these collisions over here are with two wheelers. Look at the combination here. Two wheeler to two wheeler collisions is 15%. That's 27,000. We have two wheeler to cars, two wheeler to trucks, two wheeler to pedestrians. All of these, including cars to pedestrians. That's right. People walking on the road are either hit by a car or a two-heer. And that alone accounts for more than 10% of deaths. Because 60 to 70% places, you know, the footpaths, they don't exist. And where they are, walking on them is like running in that, you know, that Olympic race that that steeple jumping thing because we're using them for this and for that, but not for actually walking. And in situations like this, a foot path sometimes isn't just a foot path. It's like an exit path for these bikers. If you can't walk on the foot path, then I mean, what? I don't know what's what's the solution. But I do know one thing. Most people don't die on the spot when a crash happens. Their life can be saved by you, me, and everyone out there. Everyone feels if you help a random stranger who's met with a collision, the police will harass you or some other issue will happen. A lot of people don't know about the good Samaritan law. It's a law actually meant to protect you from any kind of harassment if you help an accident victim. Who says up to 50% of death could have been prevented if the bystanders had just helped the people in collision. Then we have stage number two which is the ambulance trying to reach you. We live in a world where pizza comes in 30 minutes and a coffee or anything you order in groceries reaches you in 5 minutes but the ambulance may take a while. And the golden hour theory says if you get treated by a medical professional within an hour, the chances of you surviving that becomes exponentially higher. But most ambulances 55% of them take way more than an hour to reach and take you to the nearby hospital. So that period is actually lost. And because of that, this broken emergency chain, lives are lost. And what's surprising is if the victim actually needs oxygen support, 90% of ambulances just can't do that. They don't have oxygen support working in the ambulance. Now, let's be a little positive and imagine that everything worked out well. The bystanders helped. The ambulance came on time, had oxygen support if the victim needed it, and even is on its way to reach the hospital. But for some reason there is a jam on the road. We find out a few meters ahead there are two people fighting because they met with a collision. Both of them bikes and they aren't moving from that space and the entire room road is jammed. Although the ambulance has his twoe emergency on, no one looks at it. No one tries to fix it. No one lets them pass. It's really easy for us to say the government isn't doing this. The state isn't doing that. The police is corrupt and they're doing this. But let's focus and let's try to do something brave. Here's what I want you to do. Write with me every micro rule break you broke in the last week. Don't say you didn't cuz I will tell you mine. Let's see. Last week I was crossing the road. There was a line in the center which did not allow me to go to the other side. But because there was no one on the road, I was on the other side for a while before I moved back in. I would not have done this if I was abroad because I would have been fined. Second, while I was going through a turn, there was no roundabout. I was supposed to take a wider right and I went to the other side. Who's really watching? Because it's a small little gully. and reached my office a full 3 seconds faster. I think I realized I should probably not have done that. All of these micro rule breaks feel like I did a small thing and I quickly forgot it. But it's told my future self that if I make a micro rule break, nothing will change. Because we are a billion people in this country and hundreds of millions of people on the road. And when all of us think like this, those micro breaks become macro breaks and all of this happens and we think we're not part of the problem. My friend, we are the problem. If you can stop these micro rule breaks and tell one friend to stop just one rule break. The opposite happens. Everyone stops doing one less mistake on the road. And because there are hundreds of millions of us, it actually affects tens of thousands of people and their lives. Think about it and tell me what change you made. Forget about the world. Just focus on you. [Music]",

    "transcript_full": "Sir, I have invested in these stocks. I know. Now there is this News of…. . Abhishek! Sir, my portfolio is over. Dead! Dude, I have given you some work, that is not yet completed, so what news are you watching here? There is so much stress in my life, I am losing money. Should I do that work first? I think the problem is, you are looking at the news and then looking at your stock. Either you're trading or investing and you need to figure out what to do? Are you feeling anxious? Are you scared? Do you get worried? Let's solve this in this episode. Let's talk about what do you do when you see the news? How do you react to it? Different kinds of news, if you are a trader or an investor? Will you work after that? Let's see, you tell me first. Get a pen and paper. Let's begin. So Abhishek, tell me, what is your problem? The CEO of the company in which I invested was fired, and now I heard that something's getting banned, exports are going to stop. Sir, life is bad. Okay, so I think there's a lot of information coming your way. Earlier you did not see it, but once you invest in stocks, every news becomes Breaking News. So basically what to do? Let's divide news into 4 parts. There is Macro Economic news, like any event like COVID. Then there is Sectoral news, like something happened in that sector like Edtech fell, Edtech rose. Then there is the company itself, and then there could be chatter. Like brother said something, talks, rumours. You got something in chat, someone said something in forum etc. So we will define each of these and hopefully solve your problem. The portfolio will be saved. But first we  need pen and paper. Pen, paper? God, pen and paper! Gave it. Okay. Forgot to take pen. Its coming. So first let's start with Macro. What is that thing in Macro that you think will scare you? War! So COVID, 2008, anything happening at a global level effecting multiple countries is something like Macro. So when COVID happened, how did you feel about it? What did you think at that time? Sir, I had opened some chart. Thought of short selling. Came here and hit the circuit. Now again after some time perhaps the news came that we’re going to get the vaccine. Now that we’ve got the vaccine, I thought let's take it, who knows if the price will go up? Then what happened there, they said the vaccine will come after three years. Price fell again. Got it. So basically there's all this information happening, and you changed your mind twenty times in two days. Sir, I didn't understand anything. The news was valid. Fair enough. So how do you deal with this? Write! There is this company called McKinsey. It has survived 90 years. So think about it if someone had invested in McKinsey, hypothetically, as a company, what all has happened in these last hundred years? There was the Great Depression, there was the Cold War. There was the World War 2, there was the Oil Shock, multiple recessions in the United States, Population Explosion and exponential increase in computing power, we can see we have AI now. A lot has happened. The Internet also exploded, the global financial crisis happened and so did the COVID pandemic. Now imagine if McKinsey was a listed company and you had invested, you'd think friend, let's sell it. Great Depression happened, Cold War happened, Oil Shock happened. I'll sell. My point is very simple. COVID, 2008, if you add all these together you cannot actually predict what will happen in the future. Humans can not, you definitely can not, neither can you or me, nor a real supercomputer. Just imagine, even if we get Chat GPT’s, father, that too won’t be able to  predict what will happen in the future even after taking all these inputs. So this is not in your control. So whether the news is short or medium term, it is not in your control. Three things are in your control. First thing. Let's assume you know as an investor, what is a good company? Let's suppose, you think of three matrices. Okay. ROC should be good, there should be growth. Sales should also be good and assume that debt should also be zero. Example: The second thing is in your control that you think that I will stay invested for ten years. The third thing in your control is that you keep diversified between fifteen or thirty companies. Apart from this, you don't have control on anything. So now this is the investing point of view. You are probably also trying to trade. Yes. As a trader when Macros change, a Sector creates an up trend or down trend. So like in COVID FMCG was not doing that well in short term, then downtrend had started. So you can see a new trend emerge when a Macro happens. But whenever event happens, if there is a lot of volatility on that day, I mean, the day the 2008 crash happened or the day COVID became real, some people do have volatility as a strategy, like some of my friends, they trade only in events. If you do not have such a strategy, then you should not trade on such event days. Because you don't know what will happen. You tell me. Okay sir. This means that major events have taken place but it will also have an impact on the Sector, when some Sector related news comes. I mean, to understand this, let's take Warren Buffet’s example. Warren Buffet has been a huge skeptic of Airline stocks. So he said, the Airline sector is not good, I will not invest at all. Then I don't know what happened I think 2016 or somewhere there, he started investing in Airlines stocks and he put in billions of dollars and he invested in it. Shortly after, he exited them because he thought it won't do well and I think he made a loss on it as well. So, do they also suffer loss? Yes, they also suffer loss. What can we learn from this? First, no one can predict the future. Not even Warren Buffet. Second, you can't put all your money in one basket, sector. You can put in multiple sectors. Take Demonetization as an example. Money had stopped. Cash transactions could not take place. Okay? So Real Estate got affected. Correct. FMCG got  affected because rural India buys biscuits etc. only in cash. But does that mean that no one will buy biscuits? Next 10 years people will not buy? Next 1 year people will not buy? At that time, there was problem. So at that time, you will see all the FMCG companies had fallen. If you would have panicked, you would have definitely panicked. I’ll be… So you would have missed this run over here. Look how much the markets have gone up. This means, that if business is fine and something happens in some short term sector, then it will have to be considered as a short term bump, assuming the business is good. You have explained the Macro, meaning you have told me the measurement, you have told the sector. Recently, the CEO of one of my stocks, the company in my portfolio, was fired. Now if there's a company specific related rumour, then? So Nestle was very interesting. Correct. When the news came out I was shocked myself. Maggi was banned. I said what will happen now friend? Any shareholder will say that now the market will fall. So, do one thing. Can you screen cast the actual the actual date and show the chart? Massive fall, right? With volumes. Oh yeah short sell So, all the technical analyst will say in here, that brother, this is gone. But I wanted to zoom in, zoom out a little bit. Zoom out. Yes sir, doing it. Done. Do you see that? Now, zoom out a little more, turn it into a weekly, weekly chart. Weekly will be from here. Now you notice, you see that a small thing, It's a drop. That was your panic attack! Maggi Ban? That was Maggi Ban. But the price, Exactly!Does it matter? What did you learn from this? Take less tension. Sir, it means the company will not be closed. Now I have a company, so basically their revenue increased like ten to twenty percent, but their market price has fallen. What now? If the company said we faced 20 percent growth, Then the price will increase, right? How much did the market fall, 10 percent? 20 percent. Over a few days. So how does that happen? So let's answer this. So think about this, right? This is the company you want to invest in or you have invested. Let's say, this remote is that. Okay. Now, this is a big, large company. So now in this you have big FIIs, all these big banks and people are tracking all this. So now it is obvious that they have more resources than you, they have analysts, they are smart people, they track each and every thing, so they can estimate whether their earning next quarter will be Rs 100 crore or Rs 101 crore. Meaning, there is an estimate, like prediction. On the basis of that estimate, these people buy and sell. So whatever the price is, it already factors in anything wrong. So if Nestle is banned, they already know that it used to produce so much. The product was that much logistically, there is so much inventory, there is so much distribution, sales will be that much, in this season, there was that much sales in the last five sales,therefore there will be that much less sales. The market falls accordingly, because they price Nestle, according to that information that you and I don't have time to interpret. So this has already become a priced in. Now when earnings are released, these people estimate that the companies will grow twenty percent. So if the company had announced that we have grown fifteen percent, it is 5 percent less than their expectation, which is called street expectation, this is called street. So, the price would have gone down a little. Yes. Yes, so its not about only absolute profit or loss. It is about expectation versus reality. Okay then I understood this, but now one thing is, rumours. Meaning, like I was just watching a video and in that they were saying this is such and such company and they are launching this product. Not everyone knows this yet, because the views on that video were less. Secret information! Correct. Secret. Then I thought, if I buy it, will I make money. Right? But, So what is a rumour? They did not even launch the product. Rumour is unconfirmed things that sound like the truth. And usually they sound very exciting. So uncle said something, friends said something, something came in as a WhatsApp forward. YouTube video. YouTube video is a great way to spread rumours. But here is the problem. It's not designed to give you correct information. Simple method, ignore it completely. Okay it's like that. Okay. All this is fine. Now tell me what to do? Means, what should I do in the end? How to save money? What should be done now? So let's come to some basic truths. Tell me. From a trading perspective, only if you specialized in trading volatility or information or news whatever you call it, only then should you trade it If you don't specialize it, you have not done a study, don't do it. On days where large events happen, just don't trade on that day. From an investing perspective, if you have invested in a good business, and we can define a good business and you have diversified and you have given enough time, and you are willing to wait, say, 7,10 years, then let that do its job. And third, if you diversify then you spread the risk. Actually, the third is time. You do this for a long period of time. Ten-twenty years types. Meaning, even after doing it for seven years, it becomes very good. Right? So if you are able to do these 3 things over a long period of time you can do it. You know interestingly, everyone talks about Warren Buffet. But the truth is, he has done this the longest, that's why he is the richest. Okay sir. Check list is done. What job is left now? Increasing subscribers is my only work in the office. Friends, please subscribe. I will get a little bonus, right? No, no Subscribe, now!",

    "transcript_full": "[Music] yes okay hey what's going on here I love this guys but gaming is fun right so what's the big deal I mean all these guys have earned tens of lacks of rupees so why are we making such a big issue about it the problem is not the game the problem is gambling and more specifically addiction to that gambling now this is the fault of the RMG company it's actually the user because they don't understand how gambling works but there are some RMG companies out there which designed the game in such a way to turn you into a gambler even if you aren't so we have someone in the studio who's actually designed such games and this person will explain how the psychology behind making such games really works so watch the video till the end in this episode here's what we'll cover so we'll de influence real money gaming we'll talk about the good we'll talk about the bad because you know these guys just won't so let's start with the first part which is how the industry [Music] works so gaming is fun and all that so what's the big deal all these people earn tens of lacks of rupees and they seem pretty happy to me the problem is gambling according to this Source there are more real money Gamers than dmat accounts 10 CR users and I'll need a laptop for this thanks vasu over 39% of respondents say that when they played a game they actually did a transaction of real money gaming their entire industry's revenue is 100 billion dollar not for just real money gaming but the entire industry of gaming where transaction is involved so if you buy a helmet in a war game that you're playing that revenue is also included it's estimated about 30% of a 100 billion is actually real money gaming that's crazy we also know that gaming in general is one of the fastest and largest growing Industries it is more than movies and sitcoms and Netflix and all that you see combined gaming rules them all out of all entertainment channels what's interesting is that this industry is still nent it's still growing despite being billions of dollars it says that 67% growth was witnessed in India for first time paying users for these games so things are just getting started and mind you these are not Global numbers these are Indian numbers if you just look at real money gaming growth look at that it's a 57% growth 45% growth and the estimate is by 2026 it is a cagr of 25% and the estimate is a $5 billion Revenue Market but why is all this growth happening in India I think there are three reasons over here first is that smartphone growth is actually growing right there is smartphone with everyone second there is growing internet connectivity we all know about the Geo effect more and more people have reasons to go online because it makes their life better they get free internet or very low priced internet and they know how to use it entertaining is a huge industry and people want to do something with their time when they want to relax so games are a perfect way to do that and that's why there is growth in Mobile gaming too and of course I also think with real money gaming right it needs to be easy to actually pay I remember a time where I had to take out a credit card make the payment do a bunch of stuff do a 3D account secure put the password and then the transaction would happen and only credit card holders could do this but now with UPI it becomes easier to actually transact in anything and of course that UPI um technology helps real money gaming as well cuz you can just transfer 50 bucks 100 bucks 1,000 bucks into your real money gaming wallet and finally the rocket booster which is co all of this was in place and it came in line with Co it was a horrible time for everyone but it allowed anything online to do well if people actually wanted it now let's talk about the business model and thank you so much the business model is simple first you'll have to download the app all real money gaming apps are not available on the Play Store because it violates some of their terms and conditions so you have to go to their website go to the download section download the APK and then open it up and sign up now you might think this is really tough to do and no one will do that because you have to go to settings and allow permissions to actually download an APK outside of the app App Store but people actually do it because of the greed I'm guessing and they'll open it up and you get lacks and lacks of people actually using such apps so once I'm on the app I have to decide what game to play so before I decide that let me add some money to the wallet let's add say 500 rupees feels good and let's say I click on this game right here and it seems interesting now to start the game I need to do an entry fee or a boot and it says the minimum is 10 rupes so fine I can put in 10 Rupees and begin but since I'm a firsttime gamer they have said I only need to do five and everyone else does 10 great seems like a nice incentive for me to start playing so my 5 rupes goes in and I start to play now notice as soon as everyone's put in their boot it goes into a central price pool some of that money actually goes as a commission to the business so the business has now taken something despite the game outcome not ready so between 10% and 25% is what a business could take another interesting thing that these companies do is that once I try to withdraw money from my wallet let's say it's at 1,000 rupees right now I won't get the entire th000 back there'll be a small commission as a withdrawal fee that kind of sucks so in this case I'll get 950 back so it could be anywhere between 3 and 7% and so well yeah there's a withdrawal fee now it may seem that when I'm playing some of these games when people win they just withdraw it and walk away and at some point everyone could have won something but you know what real money gaming companies are really smart and they use some psychological tricks to understand basic human emotion and since I'm not an expert we have an expert in the house who's actually worked in such a company for many years and will explain the psychology behind designing such games the identity and everything about this person has been hidden for their privacy purposes but everything they share is something that happens in real life in real companies you might win the initial 5 to eight games till the time you double or triple the money that you added initially but in the very next game in which you bet the highest amount you might lose this is all scripted similarly let's say you don't open the app for a week whenever you open the app next you might win three to four games and lose again this is how your winning is actually controlled by the platform algorithms similarly your entire activity on the app is being tracked people who perform similar type of activities are often labeled into different categories and the platform then provides relevant offers based on what you are more likely to get trapped into let's say you consecutively lost 3 to four games you might randomly get a coupon saying that that you can play the fifth game for free this is how you get hooked on the platform and start adding more and more money not just this there are other ways in which you might actually not make money let's say four friends join the same card game table they might gang up and collectively collude against the fifth player in this way they distribute the entire winnings amongst themselves in short when when you download the app you might feel that what you're doing is under your control but in reality it might be 100% manipulated by the platform and you might not win when you intend to win despite all those alos created to make you an addict it's also your psychology which works against you the first is skill versus luck now when you're playing in a real world like I said before you have physics working with you you know there's an element of skill there's an element of luuck but when you're playing a digital game a lot of the things are not true it's a digital app there's an algorithm running it so how much of this is luck how much of this is skill I don't know you should decide put it in the comment this is one thing actually against you and then we have gambler's fallacy like uh this dice over here so let's say I have to get six and I roll it I got three I lost I went again got two and then I'll go again and it's three now what do you think am I closer to getting to six because I got well not a six three times in a row it feels like if I go this one more time fifth time sixth time I'm getting closer and closer to six I actually did get six and it feels like the more I lose the closer I'm getting to winning this is called gambler's fallacy and it's completely false that's not how probability Works in fact we did a video on psychology talking about a winning streak and how probability works you should check that out but the point is this the more you lose the more you'll feel that I'm closer to winning this is just not true then there's gambling addiction the truth is if you are addicted you just won't know you'll just feel like and you'll play the game you think you're winning points you lose some money now here are three questions for you one do you think about winning money when you're free maybe at night when you're asleep just about when you're taking a shower in the morning when you get up do you feel I'll be able to win something second question you can ask yourself is would it really thrill you if you made that money do you play that situation in your mind I'll earn 100 rupees will feel great I'll tell my friend I'll send a screenshot to my friend on WhatsApp and he might respond positively and the third question you can ask yourself is are you really focusing on the game for entertainment or you think this is the way you'll make a jack at one point and hopefully get XYZ for yourself that new maybe car Emi a new phone Etc do you think this is the road to riches then you'll know you're not really playing a game you're probably addicted to the gamble to the money to the hope of winning so remember gambling is not wrong as long as you do it with 5 or 10 Rupees for fun to be honest gambling can be a lot of fun and there's nothing wrong with it the problem is when you put in a lot of money into it and think the sunken cost is too much there's a difference between fun and gambling make that distinction so in conclusion I think you have to think about when you're playing this game it's just a game you're not here to gamble away fortunes that you've earned or your savings away you have to think of it as playing 5 10 20 rupees have some fun and put that phone down it's a form of entertainment that's why it's real money gaming it's not supposed to be an income source and it's not supposed to be something you get super addicted about so make that distinction and have some fun if you found this video interesting say something nice in the comments tell us what other Industries or things you'd like us to De influence and we'll take it up see you in the next episode oh that's interesting ah",

so get it in writing and then you actually know there are no fees so usually this happens someone calls you and says there are zero charges charges and eventually you find a fee and you don't know what to do with it so I'll call him no so you won't be able to call that guy what you need to do is you need to tell them that hey this is an email I got before I open an account with you from this credit card charges will not be charged and they were so please reverse the charges in most cases they should reverse the charges it will help me because I have got that WR already correct in okay in case they don't reply and say no charge then what will you do police complaint no no you can actually go to the RBI RBI Reserve Bank of India sirman means a place you can complain they solve customer yeah customer issues so you go over there within 31 days if the bank doesn't solve the issue I I'll write then also the email look I was promised this and they charge this cool I saved you some money now we got to go work I am just writing it okay yeah yeah we are working we have to go to the to meeting the client yes okay so we'll go we have to meet yes cool get my bag 1 minute later okay perfect

money so that me and you will'll be rich for sure let's do [Music] it cool yeah so we'll have to make a quick stop at the bank at the bank why sir I had this uh different account another account basically and I'm not using it anymore so I have to get it closed but I think bank I'll have to check because I have missed my average monthly balance something oh yeah that you'll have to pay hey how long have you been using this account many years but I think from past 2 years I have not been using this oh so you've not received any money in it also you not transacted also no no no no and they've charged you money for it because I have missed some average monthly balance something like that to do the process CL your process that fine is actually normal but if it's an inoperative account if you haven't used an account deit credit for 2 years it's deemed inoperative and if you've not used the account actually the bank cannot charge you a fee for it I the bank manager I mean my relationship manager called me and he told me that I have to pay see no no no no no no no not at all that's not what the rule says the rule says for an inoperative account you do not pay the fees so you can close the account and all that make make sure there's no debit credit in the last 2 years it's then deemed in inoperative you don't pay any charges for this dude so we'll go to the bank I can't help you but you tell him not to charge but if he says no T what will I do show him this circular RBI has made it very clear that uh their stance on this is very clear they can't charge you it's mandatory for them to C this out yeah yeah if you show it to them they'll agree I think someone would have missed so saved some money didn't you co you've got the presentation ready right Slide Five you have to change the stats it's ready all done all done get the C don't I'll put the bag in the car yeah now yeah 2 hours later cool thank you so much um I look forward to your email thank you was nice meeting you thank you thanks we'll get the check yes huh check check you are paying now of course I'm paying cool thank you thank [Music] you I'll pay but everything's fine right [Music] yeah so we have two extra charges now see service charge and G service charge yeah that's right you can actually remove service charge but uh no no one minute you change this coke four times right and he helped us with his smile though I think you can remove it but also I'm paying we should keep it you can remove it but this GST I think you're a little right about that you know what what are you doing so we have to make the payment yeah one minute oh perfect I knew it we don't actually have to pay GST on this but because there are two types of people who pay GST one is like the normal GST payer and the second is under the composite scheme composite scheme composite scheme any uh restaurant or company having a certain turnover which is a little low than the government has prescribed they can just pay a flat fee based on the turnover they won't have to calculate all of this so it's a little easier for them to file taxes so we can check that right now yeah so actually if you open this website this is the official GST portal okay so over here click on search taxpayer and search for a comp composition taxpayer that's the person we're looking for the composition ta the cafe yeah if you're if you're registered under the composite scheme you have a different way you're paying taxes so you don't have to charge the customer GST the GST should not be there over here if you search and you can put in the person's GST you can find this on the bill G you put this in you click on search put in the capture and you'll get it in case you don't have this you can even put the official name you know blah blah blah blah private limited you can put that legal name also once you hit search and you found that legal entity here that means he's registered under the composite scheme so we don't have to pay the GST then no but if you don't find it most large businesses will be paying regular taxes so they will charge your GST but a small business is likely to be in this so these guys should not be [Music] charging I'll get the payment yeah good job [Music] I think I think good it's nice I'm very excited we'll have it we'll have them on board cool do we the second meeting cancelled no so St to office office yes we'll have to do a couple of yeah I was thinking you know sir what happened the RBI has increased the repo rate so the loan that I have now extra yeah so what have you for I mean opted for like what's your option what did you take did you increase the loan tenure the number of months there is no option Bank n n that's not how it works so once referate goes up so what will happen is to keep your Emi the same the bank will actually increase the number of months so the loan tenure will increase okay and once that happens your Emi will stay the same but you know there's a problem in that let me show you actually one minute let me park the car this is actually pretty interesting you know we keep saying stock market invest 12% a year over a year you'll make cres of rupees over 20 years correct correct that's compounding right imagine the same thing but the bank is doing it to you so if they increase the loan tenure then what happens you'll pay more interest I have a Excel sheet on this let me show you so imagine this you have Excel sheet for everything yes that's right okay but let's suppose that this is an example I'll take a bigger loan let's suppose this a home loan 50 lakhs M okay now over here this is the current Emi now what will happen is let's suppose the home rates increase by this much okay you'll see that if the bank adds about 50 months extra extra that's about four years to the tenure your Ami Remains the Same but the interest goes up by a lot so how much how much am I paying I mean of rupes extra so it's better that instead of this if you look at the other sheet in when this happens just tell your bank don't increase the tenure just is the Emi tenure same and you pay a few thousand rupees more but you don't pay that much interest get it don't increase the tenure but Emi don't increase the tenure Emi increase increase the number of em not number of emis the amounts so if you're paying 37,000 before now you pay 40,000 or whatever it'll depend on what but in this example you'll notice that the Emi went up the tenure is the same you don't pay that extra interest so you save lcks and lacks of money and I don't think

you in every single thing that you do you help me sir and your 10 minutes Index Fund plan is not going to make me a millionaire I want to make a thousand de returns and how will you do this I'll withdraw my fnf I'll withdraw my esops I'll withdraw my mutual funds and I'll put it in dips what is dips simple the market Falls I put my money here the market rise again and then it falls again and I put my money again and the market rises again oh my God 250X 250X 250X 250X 1,000x return I am a millionaire dude this is not how it works you cannot really time the market actually you know what so you're the best Market timer yes as soon as the market is reversing you will put all my money because you know the best time the future correct okay is it let's understand this with three examples number one the guy who is the best Market timer in the world M the person who's able to buy just before the market reverses to 2008 crash ha before the reverse you're able to buy it right at the low if this person invested for the last 15 16 years what would his return be this is scenario one then there's scenario two there is the opposite of him the worst Market timer basically you as soon as you invest the market crashes the worst case scenario happens latar for 15 years if someone invests like this what will his return be and the third is the person who doesn't know whether the market will go up or down he just sips it means he invests every single month now we just compare these three the so why don't you tell me what you think is going to be is it going to be th000 X versus everyone else let's find out so to understand this let me show you a chart okay it's a really simple chart can I have it AET super this is the beautiful chart of sensex okay it starts from 86 goes all the way to 2024 what's the one thing you notice over here dip dip dip dip no the Market's went up oh oh sorry yes no also dip dip dip correct so we've marked all the dips over here and the reasons for the dips so very recently we have the Corona virus pandemic then we have the global market sell off there was the global financial crisis stock market sell off etc etc now over here every time you basically bought the dip is what we're trying to calculate correct that's what I'll do because in your Genius mind and sometimes your Genius mind you think if I can catch the dip I can earn more than let's calculate this so basically what we're going to do is throughout all these years every time the market dipped I'm going to find out the lowest low of that dip and invest 1 lakh rupes oh that's an example and let's see 1 lakh rupes 1 lakh rupes dips invest by 2024 how much money we would have fair fair fair what look at this chart over here this has all the dips you see just before the market reversed we invested to the PESA at the lowest l of that crash ENT super so we will basically find out what this 5 lakh becomes can you guess what it'll become 5 crores no it'll be 25 lakh rupes Round of Applause for this Buy on dip [Applause] Master now let's do the opposite which is we invested at the height as soon as we invested the Market fell down and this person is so unlucky so unlucky ke every time he invested the market reversed from there and he always invested the highest high possible if this has ever happened to you as soon as you invested Market girya how much money do you think this poor guy will have po guy the 5 lakh rupees actually becomes 14 lakh rupees despite him investing right at the top the highest high before the crash the guy on buying on dips which is impossible to buy right at the lowest low makes that 5 laks into 25 but the guy who invests right before the fall still makes 14 lakhs so the difference is only about 80% how did this happen sir this happens because you think investing is complicated and you have to do a bunch of things to make all that money but the truth is equity markets rise over a long period of time you really have to do nothing to make money this is warrant it's calendar by the way how would I know I didn't not check his no check out this graphic look at his calendar where is the calendar exactly he has nothing for weeks and weeks yet he makes a lot of money passively you can actually make money by doing very less by just holding on for a really long period of time but looks like it's very tough that's why you need a channel like 01 anyway let's move on to the third scenario the sips yes now in this case we don't know when the market will fall we don't know when the market will go up which is actually true no one does I've been investing since 2007 I don't know when this would happen in fact when the Corona virus pandemic happened I told all my friends Market will fall another 20% and It reversed crap anyway we all make mistakes so what if we invested every single month for 15 16 years whether the Market's going up it's going down and how much is the simp so I 10,000 I think what I'll do is I'll pick a smaller number 2,500 rupe okay with no step up no step up just 2500 rupees every month what will this guy make calculate guess oh 25 100 16 years about 17 lakh rupees now tell me the guy who was buying on dips this person doesn't exist hypothetically made 25 lakh rupees then the guy investing when the market was at its stop his Capital became about 14 lakh rupes and the guy who's doing the Sip got to about 17 lakhs which do you think is the stressfree way to approach investing stress free is IP but more money will still I would still bet on the bio two questions for you and you which is the most stress free way out of all of this sips second question did the Buy on dips earn 1,000x it would be lower no but sir I have one question okay I know this a lot of new investors don't when is the best time to start your sip yesterday today today today is the right time to do it because there is no best time there no right if the market crashed you'd still earn a return over a long period of time so who cares so idea is just do sips take so perfect I got it so basically whenever the market will fall I'll not be afraid you not P yes laptop please now what I'm going to do is let's go back to 2020 lockdown Market crashed so what we'll do is I will read the news headlines from 2020s Crash and this is the time you have to imagine that you have to invest your sip okay okay the first is covid-19 sensex post's biggest quarterly fall nifty's worst fall in 28 years stock market post worst l in history SX crashes over 3,500 points you should plan your finances in such way that your emergency fund is long you have extra money which money debt maybe all your money is not in in equities you can't do that that's very risky so I get it to basically you have to keep your emergency fund them top pay and put your money in different different assets tell me what you understood write a summary in the comments and say something nice in the comments don't forget to like And

    "transcript_full": "sir it is closing in another two hours luckily my friend called me up this morning and that this has been over subscribed 50 times I have to apply shabash yes and you see this group now yeah Han this they share updates in every one hour almost every 1 hour so see this XYZ electric 50x subscribed 100% gray market price sir will you do me a favor yeah will you allow me to apply in this IPO using your demat account I'll give you commission yes also borrow my brain how it's not gray market price it's gray Market premium and you are speculating think about how you're looking at how you're going to make money from I okay you're thinking gray Market premium correct Big Brand my friends over subscribed sir YouTube with this thumbnail etc etc over subscription yes that's not how this works see basically two ways you can make money from an IPO you can either make listing gains or you hold this company for 10 20 years 15 years because you really like the company and it compounds over a period of time actually I think that's the only way but never mind so let's focus on listing gains first what do you think affects listing gain it's probably over subscription and maybe the gray Market premium correct so let's talk about over subscription okay what is over subscription basically 1,000 Shares are available for you to buy of this company correct and there are 10,000 people who want to actually buy this 10,000 shares so it's 10x so basically the ratio show of the demand and what's available creates this over subscription number let me show you something over here in this list you can see we have and main board as well and look at their uh subscription 8X 28x 154x 20x 20x 9.5x 16. you get the point yeah they all over subscribed right sir cheating nobody knows comp we're not talking about the company we're talking about over subscription is this over subscription yes or no yes or no therefore the listing gain should be very high but- 30% - 16 - 15 -3 - 11 - 10- 9% not smart people like me got it good company and high subscription has correlation that's what you're saying right look at this top 10 IPOs in India now let's look at their issue size tens of thousands of crores right big companies large companies now let's look at their over subscription number 2.95 times 1.89 times 7 times 15.280 times can you read the listing gain for me - 7.75% - 27 39% profit so the point is very simple we go back to basics if you like the company for its fundamentals you apply for the IPO to hold it in the long term not to pop it and lock it and make some money understand sir I have a question to I saw this list but companies big companies the listing price that's actually a good question so prices go up and down when there is demand and Supply when the trading is happening so on the listing day if there are people who want to buy it at a slightly higher price and they're less sellers on the listing day when it's being traded and this continuously happens then the price goes up can anyone really predict whether that will happen when the trades are occurring no right it's too short a time frame they waiting no demand and Supply happens real time so you can't predict that CH over subscription may not be what you thought but gray Market premium correct and we'll be giving at 100% premium profitable I am rich okay tell me this yeah if the stock is not listed on the market where are these trades happening in the market but it's not not listed on the market in the gray Market where is this gray Market a gray Market is unofficial there is no real Market it's just taking place on telephone calls it happens in cash it's 24/7 but it's unregulated so basically it's a bunch of people guessing what price it may be and therefore they're transacting before the IPO which makes it speculative speculation huh so we actually did an entire video on this just remember un sh so you guys should check that out sir question if I am investing in a rising sector sector company if I invest to I'll be rich no what company it's a EV company EV sector now EV sector is rising right now look at this no 20123 global electric vehicle market value 255 billion yes forecasted to reach much more growing at a significant kager of 23% if the sector is in uptrend and if a buyer company in that respective sector that company will grow dude the sector is good but that company may not be know we think that the sector is doing well but we don't know what the company's doing thinking you can just throw a random Dot and a random company will just become a multibagger is wrong but they are making some product some some part that will be used in in the in the in the in the car or probably in the scooter can you name me the products so basically a company that is in a good sector doesn't mean that that company will do well it could but thinking it will become a multibagger is wrong every sector look at this Healthcare if you look at it has a nice growth period then there's a decline period of so many years then there's steep growth after covid same thing with it there was a period of time it didn't do well so there is a cycle that happens but if you know that there's a cycle that there'll be like four years or X number of years where it's not doing well and then there years it's doing well then it's fine if you are okay with that then that's okay do you know the cycle of it sector no one knows the cycle of anything actually this thing about cycles and sectors let me explain let's take a trip back to the 1990s this was the era of the tech grp and if a company had anything anything to do with the internet people were eager to invest in it I mean during this time Tech IPOs were the hottest thing around take the globe.com for example a company that didn't even have a solid business model but on its first day the stock jumped 600% I'm happy for the investors but dude it wasn't because the company was making any money it was just hype and many of these tech companies couldn't keep up with the expectations so the globe.com which is once the star of the show ended up being delisted in Just 2 years so what can you really learn from this the tech Boom the Doom bubble remind us that we will always see a hype cycle and a boom cycle maybe we're inside one right now let's get back to the episode some did not did not know the first place but sir everyone on the Internet is talking about this company now this person has millions of followers and he's also saying this company is good explaining everything about the company say that one influencer is not pu their perception of what is good and bad is influencing your decision and that's the entire point of 01 this is of course false think about it like this all the companies out there who are marketing how they're good are doing it because their IPOs may be around the corner like zata for example zata lost and the headline was investors lose God knows how many thousand crores now because zomato fell does that make zomato a Bad Company no correct what makes zomato a good company fundamental discounts but it's fundament and it long-term Outlook so the point is you can't go after a brand and that be your deciding factor to invest in it so I should look at the fundamentals are this is very confusing help me understand with a checklist a checklist of course I have a checklist go to the description click on it you'll see a file in front of you and check yes or no and you'll exactly know whether you are on the right path or the wrong path in 2004 there used to be employee in London who forgot to record voice I don't know why we haven't let him go yet anyway you love that's true [Music] see you the next episode and like And

    "title_current": "Right time to invest in ETFs? | Money Psychology",
    "transcript_full": "the first question what's an ETF no actually you tell me what's the full form of an ETF electronic transfer fund no exchange traded fund exchange means exchange no no stock exchange traded means can be traded like stocks and fund means it's fund exactly like an index fund so if they're pretty much the same why are we doing this video we already made a video about this actually you're right an index fund and an ETF are both passive Investments which means you're investing in say Nifty next50 or nifty50 or something of that sort but the way is slightly different what is that mean so first tell me what's an index fund index fund is a group of stocks put in together like you put in nifty50 and they're managed by a fund manager passively perfect so nifty50 stocks the fund manager basically replicates the existing index he does not pick the stocks which makes it passive correct so you're passively investing in nifty50 companies through this fund what what does it actually cost you mean nav yeah the nav net asset value correct so you buy units correct right so you're buying units it's could be one unit 5 units 10 units Etc whatever amount you're investing and this changes once a day correct now imagine the same thing but being listed on the stock exchange like a stock and this fund you can actually trade so because people are buying and selling there is no nav the the price of that ETF is changing in real time as people are buying and as people are selling like individual stocks exactly like individual stocks like this over here all of these here are ETFs and look the price is also changing H so the only difference between the two is that in Index Fund the N selected once and in ETFs it keeps changing that's all no I mean there's some more changes so one is that you need a Dem account for atfs and you don't need a demat account for index funds the other is Don cost is different so an ETF is actually cheaper than even an index fund oh so the difference is 0.1% and this is 01 to. 3% so you have to check what the difference is but in many cases ETFs are actually cheaper and finally you can't actually do a sip on an ETF because it's trading on the stock exchange right only a few brokers in India provide sip options in ETFs otherwise you have to basically open that account log into your trading account place the order every month it's like a lumps some thing and not I mean you can do it every month manually but I thought ETF was just for gold that's what we talked about last time yeah think of ETFs like a structure and you can put anything in that structure so for example you have index ETFs I mean that tracks the performance of a specific market index like nifty 50 or next50 they give you a broad exposure to all the stocks in that index then we have uh sector ETFs these sector ETFs focus on specific Industries like it or Healthcare or financial services and they allow you to invest in a group of companies operating in a particular sector then we have uh Bond ETFs or debt ETFs Bond ETFs invest in governments or corporate bonds basically the debt instruments and these are usually less volatile than stock ETFs and then finally you have uh commodity ETFs these ETFs invest in physical Commodities such as gold or silver and they'll basically give you exposure to commodity markets without you having to directly go and buy physical Goods like gold or silver somewhere so basically each type of ETF is made for a different investment goal actually let me show you something these are all the nifty50 ETFs look at the volume here very large number look at the volume here very small number what do you notice it's decreasing yeah so that means out of all the ETFs the top five ETFs are like a very large percentage of all the ETFs being traded the rest don't have any volume this is the biggest risk just make sure you don't pick a low liquid ETF I mean that's a very specific thing to look at while investing in the value and like how does this value of this current day change when I invest again later like this is if I'm doing it in the same day right but what if like I get it and then I sell it later then this doesn't this is the number that was traded today that means there enough buyers and sellers on this fund today it's likely in the future the number of buyer sellers will remain because trade so the next point is ETF [Music] cost so generally an ETF will cost less than an index fund but the ETF also has other costs that the index fund doesn't like the stamp Duty St charges there is brokerage right so you have to add all that up but you should okay I don't think you should stress on this too much if you're thinking about investing over the next 10 years 12 years it's all right index or ETF both are fine and the third point is make sure you're buying something which has a low tracking [Music] error so nifty50 is moving in a certain way and the ETF or an index fund is supposed to track that exact same thing right right but what exact same thing track that's fine why is there a difference sometimes it can I think manual human error human error it takes time to reinvest dividend target takes time to put it in fund has inflows outflows but this difference can't be too much right so the tracking error is fine it's not able to track and therefore it's an error it can't be too large so all you need to do is type in the top three ETFs you are looking to buy type tracking error you'll get Google results click on them to find out what is the tracking error for each of your ETFs right the lowest one is the better choice that's it so I think the real question is why are you investing in ETFs to make money so in fact I want to ask you the real question which is where should I invest in index funds or ETFs you'll hate this answer but actually we are investing in Index Fund so that we don't worry about the markets it sounds very counterintuitive but what you really have to do is nothing the more you do nothing and the less you react to the ups and downs of the market even day I check the market almost every single day even though I don't trade as much and I just do long-term investing I have a habit to check and find if there's an opportunity of a stock I can buy this may not actually be good the person who will do better than me is a person who doesn't care where the market is so as counterintuitive as it sounds your job is to not do anything and just focus on your trips you're making your job and the Fest of course the Fest is it done the Fest yes of course not now I have answered all your questions now go finish your work and if you have any questions put in the comments below and see you in the fast",

    "title_current": "What Buying Concert Tickets Is Like Now",
    "transcript_full": "why are concerts so expensive in India and I dug deep into the stories the numbers and all the craze and I found some four really interesting events that makes this price of 5,000 rupees go all the way to an unbelievable number and it starts with [Music] a gold play let's go let's book the tickets and just like that 1.3 CR people were actually trying to stand in that digital line to book tickets and of course what happened the app freaking crashed the demand was 100 times of the available tickets this meant 99% of people didn't get the tickets but some people did and the people who did celebrated on social media and here is when the foro began in fact some experienced ticket cuers explained how you should get the ticket without being flagged as a bot which also means if 1.3 CR people applied for the ticket some of them were maybe Bots anyway seems like people are putting more effort to understand the algo than actually their own Partners getting into a concert is the rarest of the rare once in a lifetime opportunity isn't it not really actually the live events Market is about 8,800 crores in India that's about a billion dollar and it will become about $1.7 billion really soon that's a 177% growth and it also shows that there'll be more and more events in India so a concert is not really the rarest of the rare events India does 460 million streams a day I'll say that again 460 million streams a day almost half a billion stream comes from India now when that experience turns into a live event these guys make a lot of cash for example in these 3 months all these concerts are actually happening and these are some really big names now Delhi and Mumbai May grab all the headlines but 4.7 lakh people in 2024 travel to places for concerts in places you least expect it which means the concert craze is not in just tier one cities it's happening in places like kpur chandigar goha tier 2 cities are seeing a boom in Live Events and all this demand may seem new and surprising but it's actually not think about it in India's the second largest streaming in the world and these guys aren't alone they're two three people in our office who traveled all the way to a different city and spent tens of thousands of rupees on a single concert me and Swati traveled from Noida all the way to Bombay on slightly more expensive flights the hotel was 2x more expensive and of course the tickets were kind of expensive too we spent a lot for that 1 and 1 half hours of Adam being there God was it worth it but I have a term for this it's called concert flation simple demand and Supply a bunch of people are going in a specific area at a specific time everything around it from the hotels to the flights to the taxes that you take respond to the demand with VIP pricing by flight prices are going crazy man 40K that's so expensive bro bro I'm not going yeah Abu Dhabi is way cheaper than Mumbai you are basically going to cry for the next 3 months of how much you spent for those 3 hours my point is a ticket at resale is priced at 5 to 6 times the original price you know why because they aren't selling the music they're selling something else status and all this status has created the reselling Market check this out these are two different websites the original booking ticket website and the second is the reselling website remember these tickets are not for the music it's for the experience and therefore the prices are also different over here you can see that the flow pricing was originally 6,450 but in the reselling Market at 18K the same thing for the lounge 35 to 48k the 4,000 ticket becomes 27,700 and this 3,500 ticket becomes 20,000 rupees but con inflation doesn't stop at tickets it actually extends to accommodation too now if you plan this in advance and before you go for your concert and you book it your accommodation you should be fine right because you've reserved it wrong in this example someone actually said dear sir we're excited to host you and you may know Coldplay is performing because of the buzz and excitement we cannot honor your reservation what does this mean for your booking it means that we request you to pay an adjusted rate of 16,000 rupees an increase of 10,479 for a person who had already paid it in response once this person replied unfortunately we're unable to honor our previous rating and need to make an adjustment to reflect this unethical Behavior what does this mean for your rating one star now the question is is all this hype and extra expenditure good well like everything there is good and bad for the economy it's actually really really good because 2017 crores will be added to Mumbai because of all the spillover expenses people spend about 50% on concerts but everything else was also spend on this is consumer spending and is good for the state and the city if you look at Swift onomics in America Taylor Swift went for a concert she added $14 million to the state's GDP just from two performances so overall all of us are benefiting from jenzi and Millennium philanthropy by it's a Once in a Lifetime event man you can't miss this okay fine by let's go now people will say you're spending way too much time attention money your resources on this one single event because you want to go to the concert there's nothing wrong with that if you have to choose between compounding your money over 10 years and your 20s heck choose 20s because your 20s won't come back again so spend because of YOLO don't overspend because of all of that foro foro spending makes sense because 60% of our jenta is genzi and Millennials and they have two superpowers the previous generations did not have one we actually have money also called disp ible income and two if we don't have money we have access to credit cards and other forms of credit where we can just spend with just two Taps these two superpowers allow us to spend more than our pair can exit from the other if you know what I'm saying concerts are going to get crazier and crazier bigger and more expensive and the best artists in the world are going to be here which means you'll get another opportunity to see A Sky Full of Stars [Applause] 60,000 people all on the ground racing towards the stage because now finally they're here they did so much to get these tickets they paid 4X the price of the flights of the trains even the damn hotels and now finally they look up to their favorite artist to see him on a giant screen every expensive purchase you are going to make will have two forces the for more Force which is something you have to avoid this is soal social media peer pressure friends people thinking whether you're successful or not and the second the emotional decision the reason why you should really do it because it actually has something special for you like STI and I started listening to Maron 5 20 years ago when we went to actually see them on stage it was special each of those songs carried memories of decades and it was an amazing experience so if this is the reason why you're going to see your favorite artist you should definitely go because a live event is very different from a playlist at that time if the cost went from 5,000 all the way to something really high at least you know it was worth it",

    "title_current": "DON'T Buy Health Insurance",
    "transcript_full": "[Music] In 2024, over 26,000 crores worth of health insurance claims were rejected by insurers. But why? Well, because this is the policy copy you get when you buy a health insurance. And if you look at it carefully, you'll find nine hidden clauses that make sure the insurer is not paying your bill. I even have an awful meter over here to find out how bad they actually are. So, we'll start with the first one, which is the supplement. So let's say that you bought this policy and this policy says that your sum assured is 10 lak rupees which means that if you get admitted to a hospital and you get a bill of up to 10 lak rupees the insurance provider will cover it for you and if it crosses 10 lakhs then you pay it from your pocket. So let's imagine you get admitted to a hospital and the treatment for a particular disease costs like five lakhs but you have a summer short of 10 lakh so you're safe right? Wrong. In this case, they would actually pay only two lakhs and not the five. You would pay the rest. And the reason is because of sublim. If you look over here, you'll notice that this particular disease has a sublim. So, what you have to learn from this is if you find a health insurance that's really cheap and has a great summer shirt and you think, \"Damn, I've got to buy it because maybe has a sublim. This gets a three on 10 on the awful meter.\" And it gets a three on 10 because if you miss the next clause, even if you don't have sublimits, the insurer could refuse to pay up to 50% of your bill. And when I was looking for it, I actually couldn't find it because it's sneaky. It's right here under room modifier and over here it says room rent capping. Yeah. So room rent capping is probably one of the most misunderstood clauses in an insurance contract. This is Shri. I first discovered him on his amazing writing on fin shots. He also knows a lot about insurance because he's the co-founder of Ditto. Okay. So the way this works is rumor clauses are sort of explicitly mentioned in different ways. So either you will see something like u um 1% of your sum insured is set aside for room rent payouts or you will see something like hey listen you can pick a room um anything you want so long as it's a single private AC room. Um and in both cases irrespective of how it is worded it is essentially a restriction. Now I know this may not seem like a big deal but here is where you are wrong. Imagine the limit is 5,000 rupees and that single AC room is not available but a deluxe room is available which is 10,000. So you think I'll be there for three nights 10,000 10,000 10,000 that's 30,000 the insurer said he he has a limit of 5,000 so they'll pay 5,000 total 30,000 you will actually only pay 15 and the insurer pay 15 right absolutely wrong the amount you have to pay will be 1.5 lakhs and the insurer will pay another 1.5 lakhs for the total bill to be three lakhs let me explain it's called proportionate deduction and it's freaking Crazy. Imagine this. You have a limit of 5,000 rupees for a room. Everything else that you spend, so say on surgery, medicines, consultation, etc. will come to whatever bill as long as it's within your summer assured, the insurer will cover it. But let's change one thing here. Instead of getting a 5,000 room, for whatever reason, you get a 10,000 rupee room and all these things still exist. What you just did was get yourself a better room. But you just agreed to pay 50% of the bill. You see the difference between these room rents is 50%. So the insurer says I will proportionally deduct 50% from everything. Which means if this total bill over here is 3 lak rupees he will say baba 50% 50% 50% you pay 1.5 lakhs I'll pay 1.5 lakhs. The point is this there should be no room rent capping when you get an insurance. This gets an awful clause rating of a 4 out of 10. So take a look at this over here. It's called the no claim bonus. And if you look at the no claim bonus, it'll say no claim bonus. A no claim bonus of 20% of the sums assured for each completed and continuous policy year. This is really cool for a bunch of reasons. So let's suppose your summers assured is 10 lak rupees and there's a 20% over here that is a no claim bonus. So if you don't claim anything it becomes 12 lakhs. Then the year after that if there's no claim 14 lakhs and then 16 lakhs and 18 lakhs and then 20 lakhs. You get the point. But here's the problem with it. If you get the no claim bonus um and your room rate is capped at 1% uh it does not automatically mean that it will now be calculated as 1% of your new summershot with the no claim bonus added. Instead the actual room rate restriction of 1% is calculated based on the actual summer shot. So bonus is not counted. And then we also have this little thing here called the restoration benefit. Now this is sold as this glorious thing. So let's suppose you have 10 lakh rupees as your summer assured and you spend all of it within that period of your policy and this restoration benefit will basically fill that up and bring it back to 10 lakh rupees for you to use again. Sounds good, right? But it's actually not because sometimes these guys do not allow the restoration amount to be reused for the same disease. I give this clause an easy four on 10 on the awful maker because this is actually pretty bad. But wait till you hear the next one. Co-ayment. Now notice this co-ayment thing is expressed in a percentage and co-ayment is exactly what it sounds like. You co-ay. So over here it says 20%, this basically means if it's a 1 lakh rupee bill, you co-ay and you pay 20% of it and in return the insurance costs a few,000 rupees less. But there's also another version of the same idea that features in many policies these days it's called a deductible. Right? In most cases, what the insurance companies will tell you is, hey, instead of paying sort of a percentage value, you pay something every time you have to make a claim and then whatever comes after. So the bill is 5 lakhs and the deductible is set at two lakhs, you pay the two lakhs and the remaining three lakhs is paid out by the insurance company. You're buying a health insurance just so you don't have to worry about the hospital bill. Simple solution, avoid co-ayment clause. So, I give this a simple 5 out of 10 on the awful clause meter. But wait till you hear about zonal co-ayments. So, if you open your sort of policy terms and conditions, you may see that insurance companies will have something like zone wise payment structure, right? So they'll say people in zone one will pay a certain kind of premiums, people in zone 2 will pay a certain kind of premiums and people in zone 3 may pay different kinds of premiums. And the reason why this happens is because insurance companies can then use differential pricing to target people in different cities. So for instance, if you're living in a city where medical expenses are way below the national average, then automatically insurance companies can come and say we'll offer you a lower premium simply because we don't have to pay as much to the hospitals there. However, the challenge happens when somebody buys a policy claiming that they're in a tier three city and then consistently make claims in tier 1 cities. Then the insurance companies can come and say that look, we'll mandate you to pay a portion of the bill yourself. So simple solution, avoid zonal co-ayments. Okay, this one is really important, the waiting period. The one that you should first know about is the initial waiting period, which is 30 days, which means as soon as you buy your health insurance, for the first 30 days, you aren't covered for anything. You just have to wait. And sometimes some specific diseases aren't covered for an x number of years. In this case over here, it's 3 years. So make sure this is as low as possible. Every health insurance policy has this. So let's take a hypothetical example. Let's suppose you have a blood pressure problem and you tell the health insurance people that yeah I have a blood pressure issue and for some reason you have a heart attack 1 year after you buy it. If they can connect your heart attack with the blood pressure, which is a pre-existing disease, they basically won't give you the claim. Basically, this means you should buy the health insurance when you're fit, not when you're sick. But this gets a 6 on 10 on the awful clause meter. This one's uh really cool actually and it's called the top up. This is sold like any internet recharge. You have 100 GB car limit, want to get another 50GB top up, scratch this card and pay 50 rupees. I know I know we don't have scratch cards anymore. But the same logic is for health insurance as well. You have 10 lakh rupees some assured you can get a top up of another 10 lak rupees bringing your grand total to 20 lakhs. But this has a big problem. Let's say your topup has a deductible of 10 lak rupees. It means the topup will only get activated once the medical bill crosses 10 lakhs. Now say you get hospitalized and the bill is 10 lakhs. This amount will be paid by your sum insured. But now let's say you get hospitalized again and this time the bill is 5 lak rupees. Now even though you have a 10 lak rupee topup that is useless because the topup only gets activated if the medical bill crosses 10 lakhs. So you will have to pay all the bill by yourself. So this clause gets a seven on 10 on the awful meter. So what should you actually get? You should get the super top up. So instead of you having to pay the deductible over and over again every time you make a claim, all you have to do is pay the deductible once and the insurance company will pay out the remaining expenses. And so you don't have to worry about paying the deductible every time you make a claim. And then we have daycare. So if I look at this over here, we can see daycare procedures and treatments. Over here it says all procedures are covered up to annual sumsured. Basically it means if you have to get hospitalized but it's not 24 hours. It's something that you're in a procedure for a few hours or basically in daycare less than 24 hours. This could be say cataract or dialysis or tons of other things. Then does the insurer actually cover it or not? Cuz these are valid procedures that are affecting your health and the insurance must cover it. But some of them don't. Why? Because they add a clause over here that says you must be hospitalized for at least 24 hours before you cover it. Which basically means that the health insurer is not covering daycare. Not covering this would be very sneaky and I would give that clause a easy seven on 10 on the awful clause meter. And now we have [Music] cashlessness and reimbursement. But what is it? Few years back what would generally happen is insurance companies would automatically force you to pay the bill yourself. So first you pay the hospital then you wait for a few weeks and then insurance company eventually says look I'll pay out that money to you because you paid the hospital. Now unfortunately this isn't very easy for the customer especially when you're dealing with a medical crisis. So nowadays most insurance companies offer you a cashless benefit which basically means that you don't have to collect all the bills the medical documents none of that. Instead the hospital will do it for you. They'll send it to the insurance companies. they'll get approval and then the insurance company will pay the hospital directly. So you don't have to pay anything out of pocket. But imagine you have an accident and they take you to the nearest hospital and over there that hospital is not a network partner. Therefore, you can't use this and you have to foot the bill yourself. Why would you do that? I'll give this an 8 on 10 on the awful clause meter. And the most evil clause is right over here. It's I can't even spot it. It's that small. There's a star over here. And if you see the end, it says reasonable and necessary. Here's what it means. So unfortunately in India, we don't have something called as a standard rate card. Um effectively because every hospital can choose what they believe is a fair price for a certain treatment. So hospital can overcharge an insurance company may have no other recourse except to pay up. So what insurance companies do is within their terms and conditions they have a standard clause. They say look we only pay for costs that are deemed customary and reasonable. Reasonable means look the costs must be deemed reasonable. If you have a injury to your shoulder or you need surgery to the shoulder it can't be that you need treatment and the surgery costs add up to 25 lakhs. Anywhere across India you'll probably end up paying 2 three lakhs. Anything beyond that sum may be completely unreasonable. Right? So we will only pay for costs that are deemed reasonable. What are customary is so let's suppose the hospital decides to add a bunch of ancillary charges that have no relation to the actual treatment right. So the insurance companies will always ask do doctors administer this? Do they do this? Is this the treatment protocol? So they look at that and then if the charges are not deemed customary then insurance companies can also say hey look we are now going to pay up. Now who decides what is reasonable and customary? Um unfortunately the way it works is insurance companies generally decide what is reasonable and customary and most customers have no recourse. One minute you are saying to and I'm admitted at the hospital. I need to go and check their rate card with other people to find out if it's reasonable or necessary. I'll say come because my insurer won't give me the payment. And just because of this, I'll call this a 10 on 10 on the awful, no, on the evil scorecard. But the question is, how can you safeguard yourself? Well, here are three things that you should know to protect yourself. Pause this video to read",

    "title_current": "3 Best Mutual Funds for SIP!",
    "transcript_full": "[Music] I know you've seen this and I know you want these returns. So, I built a tracker for you so you can track any mutual fund and compare based on performance, risk and cost. And right here, right here you will know the result and it starts with rolling returns. Definition annualize average returns for a period ending with the listed year. Wait. So, we are on the Excel sheet and I'm in the performance tab. We have the fund names on top. So, I'll put fund name, but I'm picking a random mutual fund. Do not invest in this fund. Do not do anything. This is just an example. So, I go to this website called advisorc.com. Click on MF research. Then choose rolling returns versus benchmark. Here I just type in the fund name. Pick a start date. Choose the time period. Submit. Now you see this chart. Orange line is the fund. Blue line is the index. It's Nifty 100 in this case. So for HDFC large cap, it shows 18.04% and the index is at 13.81%. I simply note that down in my tracker. Notice I didn't use the current return. But when you do this, make sure to check the latest numbers. Then I do the same thing for the other two funds also. SI Magnum and Nippon Small Cap. We need one more thing which is rolling return versus category average. You can get this information following this. Now just look at all the numbers. You will see two of the funds did better than both the index and their category average. One didn't. So this is your first decision point. Remember when you're doing rolling returns, compare many mutual funds and check for 5 years or more. 3 years I've done as an example. But returns aren't enough. The biggest problem in markets is risk. We have seen a sharp fall, a crash in the Indian markets. What if you lost a lot of money because of the mutual fund? You've picked some lockdown India very very tough very tough. So I want to talk about risk right now and it's called the sharp ratio. [Music] I'll get the laptop please. Perfect. So this is Morning Star. You will have to type the fund name here and this new page will open. Click on risk and ratings. Then select 3 years. Under the risk and volatility measures table, you'll see 0.75, that's the funds sharp ratio, and 0.46, that's the category average. I'll put these numbers into the tracker and do the same for the other funds. You'll notice that the sharp ratio of all these funds is higher than their respective category averages. And that's where the sharp ratio comes in. It will tell you exactly how risky this fund is in relation to the returns it's given. And this reminds me of an interesting thing and that is called standard deviation. So let's look at it what it looks like on uh our sheet. This data has been sourced from the Morning Star website. So let's check the volatility of the funds we chose. 13.18% 14.35% 14.38% 16.94% 17.36% and 17.43%. So if the fund's standard deviation is less than category standard deviation, it shows lower volatility, otherwise higher volatility. You can check for funds in your portfolio too. Just compare each fund's standard deviation with their category standard deviation and you'll know which fund is more stable and which one takes more risk. The lower the standard deviation is, the better. So now it's time for beta. Basically fund are subjected to market risk. Please read the document carefully. musical. Okay guys, basically it's called beta. Whatever you invest in, there will always be some volatility. Now, you want to make sure the volatility of your fund is not more volatile or too volatile compared to its benchmark. So, let's say Nifty 500 or Nifty 100 or Nifty. Don't confuse this with standard deviation which is measuring volatility of its own performance with itself. VA's comparing relative. So now to understand beta, you actually have to see what it looks like on a freaking Excel sheet. Let me show you on three different funds what this looks like. [Music] Okay, now let's go ahead and enter the beta numbers into the sheet. This data has been sourced from the Morning Star website. We're comparing each funds beta with the beta of its category. As you start filling it in, you'll notice two of the funds are on the conservative side and one is aggressive. Just to make it clear, if a fund's beta is lower than its category, it's considered conservative. If it's higher, that means it's aggressive. This gives us a quick idea of how much risk each fund is taking compared to others in its category. So, a beta of one means that it moves exactly like the market. A beat of greater than one means that it is more volatile than the benchmark or the market. And less than one, you guessed it, it's less volatile. But does it always mean that more than one is bad? Not really. And for that, we have something called the capture ratio. The capture ratio is basically looking at whether your fund is capturing the upside and the downside of the market or not. Let me explain. Let's say Nifty goes up by 1%. And your fund also goes up by 1%. That's an upside capture ratio of 100. If Nifty falls by 1% and your fund also falls by 1%, your capture ratio is now 100. So this means it is moving exactly like the benchmark. But what if the capture ratio is 120 on the upside and 80 on the downside? This means that it's going up higher when the market moves and it's falling lesser when the market falls. Now that's an ideal case scenario. But look at this example over here. So in the tracker we have the funds upside capture ratio, category upside capture ratio, funds downside capture ratio and category downside capture ratio. So let me put all the numbers here. Now look at HDFC's ratio. it is 103 which is more than the category average of 100. This means the fund is better at capturing the movement when the market is going up. Likewise, I've included the numbers for the other funds too. And this is the result. The next thing is the downside capture ratio. The downside capture ratio of your mutual fund tells you how much of the market's fall the fund is actually capturing. I've put the numbers here and you can see all three funds downside capture ratios are less than their respective category averages which means they fall less than their peers when the market goes down and that's always a good sign. So this is our final sheet summarizing our analysis based on performance risks and cost for rolling returns. We compared each fund's return with the benchmark and category average. For all other metrics like sharp ratio, beta and capture ratios, we've compared each fund with its category average. You can use this sheet as a ready reference to filter good quality mutual funds and build a portfolio that matches your goals. So notice how all of these things will intermingle in play. You have returns on one side, you have capture ratios, you have standard deviations, you have volatility. All these things are ways to tell us whether you're comfortable with that fund or not.",

    "title_current": "Living in Delhi's Toxic Air during Winters 🧣",
    "transcript_full": "[Music] It's a few days before Diwali and the air is kind of clear. But on Diwali, this is what it looks like. But I found out the air pollution in Diwali is not just because of the firecrackers but something else entirely. And I have an experiment to actually show how all of this works. But before we do that, I'm going to use this an AQI monitor to measure the pollution and the air quality from my home all the way to the office and figure out how is all this happening. Where's this pollution coming from? And I need you to count with me everything you found surprising throughout and put it in the comments. Let's start with this. The AQI or the air quality index. It basically measures a particle PM 2.5 telling you how clear or polluted the air is. >> So PM 2.5 is basically the size of the particle. 2.5 is 2.5 micrometers. And when you breathe the air these particles go into your body they can cause prothrombotic states that can make your blood thick. It can increase your risk of heart attack, strokes, lung problems, a whole host of problems including even cancer. Now even though we can't see these particles it actually reduces life expectancy by 10 years and puts us on the wrong side of the map. This shows the number of deaths in every country and India and China and a bunch of smaller nations are the worst hit. But you know what's interesting is there is no indoor air quality standard. The air purifiers here do give you a measure but we don't have standards in India yet. When you burn a mosquito coil, it's equivalent to something like 75 to 137 cigarettes. And all these other activities also create pollutants at home. It means frequent changes to your AC filter. >> You have to buy new air purifiers. This costs at least 10,000. Now, home pollution is more of a choice. I can do a bunch of things and make sure the home is actually clean air to breathe. But the moment I exit, the moment I go out, everything changes, right? So let me get ready for work. You know when people leave indoors they think everything is not in their control. Economists call this externalities and that's where the real culprit hides. So vehicular emission is about 25 to 35% in the country. Delhi is about 40%. Mumbai is about 30%. Bangar is also really high which means most of the air pollution is happening because of vehicles. If all of the vehicle pollution is roughly the same in all the cities, why does Delhi have so much pollution and why does Diwali look like that? Let's look at the population. Delhi's population is about 34 million in 2025 and by 2030 it'll be 44 million. Now when the population goes up so much of course the vehicles I think will double maybe even triple and capitalism is a little weird. We move to cities then we work over there to get a better life only to be stuck in traffic for hours and you know what cars that aren't even moving like us right now stuck in traffic create even more pollution because the engines are running. there's no momentum and it just causes more pollution. >> Then there are all these different gases which are released sulfur oxide, nitrous oxide, formaldihide which are also byproducts of combustion and these gases are also toxic to the body increasing the risk of a whole host of problems, lung problems, heart problems, cancer. The point is this the small things that happen in our lives toa we got late to office we got stuck in traffic for an hour etc etc on a population level on a state level on a country level just multiplies and becomes billions of dollars lost and it's not like the government doesn't know about this they've actually actively tried to solve it like CNG they've tried to ban vehicles over 10 years old of cars inside certain areas so developed nations have a different solution altogether. In a place like Singapore, they have the ERP system where as soon as you cross an ERP, it automatically deducts money from uh the wallet that you have. The next biggest pollutant is construction and demolition. This is not that surprising if you see all of this. By the way, the current AQI inside this car is 25. It's not bad. But if I open this and check out here, it's a crazy 85. And this is not because of vehicle emission cuz I don't see any cars over here. I only see construction. And construction and demolition accounts for 40 to 50% of all air pollution. On this stretch of road, there are a bunch of construction sites. And every construction site has these massive massive trucks and all of this contributes to air pollution. I also don't understand road every single construction site across the country. I don't know why but there's one good thing in just a few days all these construction sites will be stopped and will come to a halt because in Delhi it's not allowed to run construction during the winter months. This forms under the GRAP norms which is a way for CND to actually reduce contribution to pollution and I guess that's a good thing. I hope people actually follow it though. But you know even with construction we are not completing the full picture of why the Diwali air looks so bad. >> There is poor quality during the entire year as well. The reason why we talk about this during Diwali is because that is when there is that parali burning and the crackers happening and the pollutant level suddenly increases multiffold. So let's talk about stubble burning which is when farmers burn their crops after harvesting say wheat or rice. Now this is a simple way for farmers and a cheap and free way for them to get rid of the leftover stuff after the harvest. Another way is to actually get a machine which will clean it up. But the machine is expensive and burning is free. However, because of stubble burning, the actual contribution to air pollution is only 8 to 9%. This entire event happens around just a few days. So basically, although it's 8 to 10%, it's concentrated over just a few days. And we have another source that says during a period of time when the air pollution was at over 150 the contribution from this was less than 1% from the actual fires which means it can't just be the fires right in a world where stubble burning completely goes away there will still be toxic air in Delhi so if it's not stubble it must be firecrackers every news channel is basically saying firecrackers and stubble burning. This is the cause for the air pollution. Now, I'm not saying this does not cause air pollution. It does. But take a look at this. This chart shows the air pollution over the last few days. So, it's at this average. It's at this average and then boom, you get this spike on Diwali because of the firecrackers. So, there is a connection. But if you look at the next day, it goes back to normal levels. So if it's not the stubble burning, not the firecrackers, not the construction, not everything we discussed including the cars, then what is that one thing just came out? They said the air becomes so terrible in Delhi. Let me show you. Come here. >> The 01 team made this just for you to explain just this concept. So over here you can see this is Delhi. Cold air flows down from the Himalayas and cools the city's already cold surface and above it sits a layer of warm air. They form kind of like an atmosphere sandwich like a blanket and guess what gets trapped in between pollution. And I have this machine over here which can generate some and imagine this is happening in the winter. So all the vehicular dust, all the construction, all the demolition, everything comes over here and because the air is cold and there's a blanket on top of it, that smog does not go away. This is called a temperature inversion. Which is why in Diwali you see suddenly it's become so so bad. Now air should actually come and ventilate the entire city but it doesn't because of Delhi's geography. If you notice we have the Himalayas here and there is wind coming from this side. It's almost like a natural wall preventing ventilation from happening. But imagine if the same thing happened on this coast or this coast, let's say Chennai, and you have the same vehicle emissions, you have CN D and this is really bad. All you really need is a seab breeze and the ventilation does this. [Music] And because of the ventilation, because it's on the coast, although the city is producing a lot of pollution, the air isn't as bad as you see right here. So what does this mean? Does this mean that because of this geographical problem, Delhi is doomed to be just a gas chamber forever? Actually, no. Delhi is very specific and can teach every single city about something really important. that all of this happens because of us, because we do the construction, because we move to cities, because we drive the car. Remember co it was a really tough time. But a little silver lining was the air. The air was amazing. The sky was blue and there were even cases of animals coming on the street because humans weren't getting out. All the reasons air pollution happens, man-made, were completely stopped because of the lockdown. That means if we are a little more careful and we think that Delhi is ours or the city is ours and maybe we take one less trip in the car, maybe do a carpool, maybe try to figure something out with the construction sites, the government can do that. And believe me, if all of us did that, it would actually make a huge difference. If you're going to do something this month to make the air slightly better, let us know in the comments. Goodbye.",

    "transcript_full": "One in five iPhones are now manufactured in India and we're finally competing with China at a global scale. But recently, China has made a few quiet moves that could shake India's 4 lakh crone industry. In just a few years, India has dominated smartphone manufacturing. We are the second largest manufacturer in the world. And all this happened in just the last decade. Today, we manufacture 20% of all iPhones in the world. 20% of the world may seem huge. Well, it is actually huge. But all this is happening in a small town in Tamil Nadu called Shri Perodur. And people are slowly calling this place India's electronics capital. Foxcon is the company that's making all this growth happen. And this Taiwanese company is Apple's biggest iPhone contract manufacturer, famous for building whole cities in China just to make Apple products. And for the last few years, it's making iPhones in India, too. Now, Foxcon is not only building iPhones here. They're also now planning to introduce AirPods and semiconductors, too. All growth comes at a price. And this price was paid with attention by another nation, China. China didn't have much of a reaction when India did three major reforms. Policy, infrastructure, and legal. Under policy measures, the most important initiative was the production linked incentive scheme. And you can see Foxcon, Megatron, Tata Electronics, and many other entities all benefiting from it. But clearly Foxcon made the most of it. iPhones contribute to less than 5% of the total smartphones in the country. But if you look at the numbers, you'll notice out of the $1 billion for the PLI, 75% has gone to contractors which are manufacturing the iPhone. Now for India to make sure its manufacturing ambitions actually become reality, it needs a basic thing to happen. Manufacturers must manufacture in the country. Now being a country, you can't really force them to do something like this. So you do it via policy. And one policy was actually making it tough or very expensive to import finished products from abroad. Therefore the only way for the economics to work is the manufacturer that is Foxcon actually set up shop in the country and then there was support from the Indian government actually more specifically Indian states the southern states of India is where all the manufacturing happens particularly if you look at Tamil Nadu you'll notice that the ports are nearby you have enough skilled labor to actually do this kind of job more than willing to work at such factories and the state government actually co-invested by creating dormitories to house all these workers. Foxcon remembers that all these things really really matter. Think about it. A single campus can have three lakh employees like the one in China. And during co Foxcon had a hard lesson. China had a zerocoid policy at that time and they basically shut down the entire factory of those three lakh people and because of this Foxcon was not able to produce iPhones. Of course, CO is important, but for whatever reason, those targets were not met, which obviously hindered iPhones sales. Because of this situation and because it was completely out of their control, remember Foxcon is a Taiwanese company, they knew that this control, because it's out of hand, would affect their top line. But here's the real pressure point. You know, today Foxcon may be a Taiwanese company, but 70% of its sales come because of China. Somewhere that flipped the power equation. It's now Foxcon that is hugely dependent on China for its supply chains. The story started 20 years ago when China put pressure and said, \"We want you to create industrial clusters in China.\" And that's exactly what Foxcon did. So not only did it make supply chains over there that were very strong, skilled and they understand how this works but also the labor over there is very skilled and understand how it works. So the Chinese need to show us Indians how to actually make the iPhones because all the technical knowhow is over there. Less than 1% of Foxcon in India is Chinese. But those 1% they actually own all the really important technical and managerial roles. And China knows this. So it uses it as a pressure point. Recently they took back a few hundred Chinese employees who were really important for the manufacturing back to China and that obviously hindered performance of the manufacturing phones in India. Now think about it. Foxcon imports all the machines from Chinese companies. So those are Chinese machines. The spare parts everything Chinese companies hold. The service is also done by them because the manufacturing of those machines is cheap. You have to rely on China to actually supply those machines. Second problem, those machines run on Chinese code. So even the manuals, the rule book and even they say the emergency button is written in Mandarin. Now apparently Foxcon has asked the suppliers to actually change it to English. But those machines haven't come here yet. My point is simple. Just because we have production happening in India doesn't mean the entire benefit goes to India. China seems to also benefit and in many cases seems to hold some really pressure points for us. Now there are two possibilities over here that importing the machines getting the English versions and all these issues are just a speed bump and things will be fine or the alternative they won't be able to import the machines and the Chinese executives and workers will not have access to the Indian plants for whatever reason. Now if the second one plays out they'll have to figure out a solution. Now, Foxcon has enough money to survive a next storm, but what if it has to import machines from a different manufacturer? Which is more expensive? Should be all right, right? Until you look at this. Foxcon's margins on the iPhone is just 3%. 3%. Which means that it has to run like clockwork. The entire business from start to end. times have to be optimized and you have to squeeze every amount of energy to take the manufacturing out at pristine quality at the lowest time output possible because the margins are just 3%. So processes become where you actually make the money and if there's any input cost that goes up it could make the entire business unviable and there's a ballinch connection here which means that if Foxcon becomes weak all the other supplying companies nearby which are actually helping in that production and the workers also face a threat. So it's not just one company it's that entire cluster. Trade must be smooth. So there's no need to actually do it yourself. So you import the things that your country cannot. However, if the trade is disrupted, the importing country simply finds an alternative. And this is what's going to happen with India as well. It's going to find an alternative on all the things we depend on China. From skilled labor to even manufacturing of certain specific machines, India has a technical know-how and the companies which can actually figure it out. And the gap left by the Chinese workers leaving the factory is already trying to be filled by Foxcon. They're trying to hire from South Korea, Vietnam, and all other countries to replace that workforce. There is a much more detailed version of this entire story.

    "transcript_full": "Everything that you see on the internet, you mean the colors, the products, when to buy, the discounts, even the timing, it's all not random. It's actually engineered so optimally that it'll blow your mind. And it's called the choice architecture. Now, you probably have never seen marketing like this. So, we'll discuss it through these seven, I think, evil tactics. stuff that shouldn't happen but happens every single day without you knowing it. So what you're going to do is let's give ourselves a conscious score. If you knew it, give it a one. If you didn't know it, give it a zero. And then let's put the scores together in the comments to understand who has reached where. Have you ever noticed when you're passing by some burger joint and you're telling your friend and suddenly you get an ad from that very brand selling you that burger? I've always thought my phone's listening to me. But there's another way. It's a little more sneaky than listening to you. It's called geo fencing. Geo fencing basically is using your phone as a beacon and creating an area around it. I have a friend Raguandan. He used to run this company called Taxi for short. Basically, you would go to his app, order and people could get a cab. But he told me something really interesting. When people landed at an airport in the arrival zone, they would actually get an ad that they can get a cheaper ride home using taxi for sure. This blew my mind because the customer and the need is right there and you can just test whether they need your thing or not. His idea was simple. If he can get the right user at the right place when they need the cab, his company would eventually grow. But some people take this tech and make it a lot more evil like changing prices. Imagine you have two different malls. One is super expensive luxurious mall and the other one is a normal mall. I actually found this LinkedIn post where a person ordered a cab to both the malls. He and his friend, no distance between them, same cab, same time and the prices were different. This is geotagging at its best. This customer can pay more, charge him more. This customer is likely to pay less, charge him less. Now, you can use a geoence to do a targeted ad, but how do you know someone's going to click? Why would someone click? Well, there's a science behind this. Take for example 01's YouTube channel. Now, they're not selling anything to you, but they want you to see their video. So, they need you to click on the thumbnail. So, a simple scientific way for us to figure out what you're interested in is run a simple AB test, which is have two different thumbnails, one with a certain text and one without a text, or one with red a little bit more and one with less red. The first one is showed to 100 people and we can see that six out of 100 people clicked. The second one is shown and we can see that three people clicked. Therefore, option A wins and that thumbnail is seen by everyone. This is called an A or B test. Now, this is just a YouTube channel. Imagine all the FMCG companies out there, all the products out there with dedicated teams running real AB tests, thousands of AB tests to figure out what you really, really need to make you spend money, to make you a little bit poorer. Sometimes the desire to buy something isn't there. It's actually manufactured. Now, once someone's clicked on an ad, there is another click to be made that's on the landing page. And you can actually run an AB test on a landing page as well. Like I found this interesting case study here by going and you can see on Going's homepage, it has a bunch of copy, but look at the button. The button says trial for free. And they even have uh arrows in case you missed that there's a button over there. And they ran a second AB test. Everything's the same except they change the color of the button and they said join for free. Now whether it's trial for free or become a member for free, they all probably mean the same thing, but one gets way more clicks and they exactly know which one. And once these guys have caught your attention and you click, you actually enter the second zone of this entire funnel, the consideration stage. And you didn't even know it. And it all really starts with this harmless pop-up. I find this really weird. Without seeing the product, without seeing the page, it's asking me to accept this this cookie. The cookie finds your preferences, tracks you, sees what you're doing across everything to personalize ads. I found this interesting infographic here explaining the different kinds of cookies and what they track. I mean, over here, they're tracking something that's outside of Google, within Google. When you're following a certain page, it even tracks timings and locations. Cookies are the reason why when you go to a running shoe website and you like a few shoes, you see ads of all kinds of running shoes across the internet. Ultimately, your self-control and willpower will give in. Even if you wanted to kind of buy that shoe, now you will probably buy that shoe because you see nudges everywhere. The first nudge is going to be an ad. there going to be a second ad, a third and a fourth. If you interact with it, the algorithm will then push content your way. Then you go to a different website. You get the right ad at the right time, maybe even near your payday. And finally, you hit the And if you think I'm exaggerating, here's the next tactic. Look at this page. So normal. There's a button here. There's a sign up there. You won't guess. They're actually tracking your eyes, but there's no way that they can see your eyes, right? But interestingly, your eyes and your cursor move exactly at the same place. That's how you read a book on the internet. That's how you look at stuff. You move your cursor like your eyes. So, they have a software installed. Every time you move the mouse, they are tracking that and it's actually turned into this video. If you play this video, that entire session on the entire website whilst you're there is recorded. And they're pretty popular tools to do this like Crazy Egg, Hot Jar, and you can use this Google Chrome extension which actually tells you whether they're recording your screen or not. Imagine a group of people sitting every single day in a company watching every single video for every single user trying to optimize for conversions. At some point when it's overoptimized, they will use dark tactics to make more money. Now, I'm not saying all companies use dark tactics, but I'm sure a lot of people didn't know that this tech actually exists. So, these softwares also create a heat map. So, if you don't want to see a single session, what you'll do is you'll just see a generic heat map of where people spend the most time and the least time. So, you have hot and cold zones. Now, let's say a business is selling watches and they know you've spent a lot of time or most users have spent a lot of time on this center watch as shown here in red. So, what they'll do is they'll increase the prices of the other watches to make this look slightly cheaper or say that this is not in stock or only one in stock and use a bunch of other psychological tactics to make sure slightly more people prefer and buy this watch. Now I know you might say dude at the end of the day I am making the purchase. Sure they're making some microscopic changes over here and there nudging me but I actually have to make the payment. True but actually the data looks slightly different. If you look at this right here these are small ticket personal loans that are loans under 1 lak rupees. Now I know you can't buy a car in 1 lakh rupees or a house or anything. you're buying these small items. Because these nudges exist and because taking these loans is super easy, people are just consuming more. So, we know how they catch attention. Then, we also know how they get us to consider their product cuz they use all these tools. But once they do, they need to nudge. Nudges are of all these kinds. And all of them are super interesting, right? Like this one says only one in stock. Hey, you're a trillion dollar company and you have one stock. It's a lie. But you know that pop-up you get on the side where it says, \"Abishek just bought these pair of socks and it feels like everyone's buying and you're not.\" That's actually a Shopify extension. I really mean it. You can go install the plugin and it just works out of the box. Nudges have been turned into pieces of software you just install and they have sort of hacked into you so you can buy It's that easy now. It used to be a science. Now it's just a plug-in. You know when you add an item to the cart and then you don't purchase anything and you wait and you start doing something else and then you forget you had added something to the cart and then you get a message which is [Music] discount. Has this ever happened to you? It's called the abandoned cart effect. Actually, it's a real thing. Abandoned carts are perfect places to upsell customers because it shows that someone wanted to buy something but for whatever reason didn't buy it. They got distracted, they had second thoughts. So, if you're using an app or that person uses email, you can just create this flowchart. This flowchart basically says after a person has kept something inside the cart, wait for x amount of time and then do an offer. This could be an in-app notification or an email sent to them. This is triggered automatically for thousands of customers in real time based on whatever flow you want. It's kind of like when you're trying to buy the dress on the roadside and then you walk away because you've abandoned the cart and they say, \"Excuse me, madam. Please discount. Please buy.\" It's exactly the same thing except it's digital, fully automated, and it has more data about you. So, it's a little more deadly. And just like you don't want another credit card, you also don't want to buy stuff you'd never intended to. But that's where you're wrong. And that's where we get a recommendation system. And the top of the line is Amazon's. I personally think it's quite useful. And I actually buy a lot of stuff because those recommendations are quite useful. And you might think it's just one row, but it's not. The recommendation system is all these things. So the question is, are your choices really your choices anymore when there are 100 different nudges nudging you to what you should do next? Think about buying protein powder. Once you buy protein powder, it knows exact date. once you've received it and maybe 25 days later it can nudge you to buy the next protein pack. And if you don't, it might nudge you for something even better, creatine. And once you buy the creatine, I'm sure they'll think that you need a water bottle so you can actually shake that thing and drink every single day. But this entire video was actually a trick. Everything you saw over here, you think that this was actually what we were decoding when it really wasn't. This is how people used to do stuff. But now in the age of content, a piece of content is the actual ad. And all of these things are baked right into it and you just don't even know. and that conscious score. [Music]",

    "transcript_full": "sir H I want to make money okay okay from Trading full-time Trader what will I do in that make a trading plan for me okay so you'll help me play this game and we Al Jenga and we'll also learn how to build a trading plan [Music] okay let's start with how much Capital you have how much I want to make 1 CR with 10,000 you have 10,000 rupees right now total I was joking sir I have enough Capital yeah what is enough have you figured out the stuff we discussed last time your health insurance life insurance emergency fund all of those different different things investing long-term sap and then if some money is left maybe you trade in done done okay so what's your trading Capital left over after all of that 50,000 50,000 rupes is not bad it's not bad okay so after you get 50,000 here's what you need right so the first thing you need is a trading plan like you told me so imagine a business any kind of business needs a business plan okay how much Capital you put what's the risk how much revenue how much blah blah blah blah blah blah blah right okay uh the same thing you need for trading you need uh entry exit um profit profit risk management is very important some back testing results anyway we'll talk about that you need a trading plan and then you have to choose whether it's Equity or f look you are very new so equity is what you should start with Equity is buying a company just stocks yeah just normal stocks oh yeah no no leverage no Futures no options nothing um so why don't you place a trade actually um how will you do a stock selection what are you going to select I woke up in the morning I ate Chan Pras think of a company what how did you come up with a company I ate CH in the morning okay that's what I could recall as of now nice I wish I had your life free time okay so why don't you add dber over there also your your Chan is next should I add D or should I play Jenga Jenga Jenga remove one and add one share over there and purchase the share right now go ahead done did the order was the order placed yes done okay go to positions what's the profit and loss right now P 15 PES is it PES 25 PES lost sorry profit okay what's going to be your exit when will you exit if it's a profit when will you exit if it's a loss when my gutfield tells me exactly a trading plan is supposed to Define so why don't we add this over here oh it was my turn no yeah a trading plan is supposed to Define your entry your exit and your target right so look at this your target your stop loss and your entry so entry you already did although it is not mathematical please never buy a stock randomly um stop loss should be defined risk and Target should be defined reward what is profit out of this so if you enter and it hits your profit Target then it becomes a profit um and if it's uh and if it goes down you make a loss then your loss should be defined so if your entry was 100 and your stop- loss is 90 what's the risk 10 correct so now you will not lose more than 10 Rupees assuming you actually place that stop- loss oh I should know that yeah this is a very important part of a plan right you should know your maximum risk your dad runs a business right huh any day he knows maximum risk on a single day or a single month in terms of rental because he signed a contract and he knows s correct so he's defined his risk in terms of rupees and then he says okay if I sell so much Goods in the month I'll make a profit correct so he knows his break even point oh it is going red should I exit no not yet let's just take this loss and understand it through this so Target stop loss entry so we cannot just place a stoploss whatever you feel like do what you need is a back tip s what I tell you what I need I need to increase this that's right how am I supp so that's actually a really good point no no that's a that's really good point if your target is this then your stop- loss should be this so now we can see that if your stop- loss is smaller than your Target and the number of Trades you take are more profit so you took say three profit trades or right and you took one loss trade this Trading plan will actually make money sure yeah because no no just look at the stats right your stop- loss is only one block but your target is 1 2 3 four blocks for every trade for every trade say in a in a these are statistics so in say 10 trades uh one trade was a loss and say six trades was a profit for example then overall you have more profit trades and each time you made a profit you made more blocks then you lost in this this is called a system and you'll have to run the system for decades B 30 years 40 years it could be anything I want to make money for my you're very G you will not be able to reach a billion dollar so easily what did you say I pay your salary hello so this is called a system so this is risk reward this is win loss ratio over here one what loss ratio win loss ratio so tell me how many trades one over here three and how many trades lost one so it's a three oh got it yeah usually this is done out of 10 I didn't I ran out of blocks but basically out of 10 trades if five trades are win five trades are loss what's the win loss ratio G 50 50/50 but there's also sequence risk for example if your win loss ratio is 50 50% you can still get 10 losses in a row in fact we did an entire video about it right here check it out but how will I know this ask me how will I know this how will you get these stats that back test Ah that's right the back test so how do you know this system works or this strategy Works back test back test you basically test it over the last 20 years whatever 10 years get statistics and find out what was the risk reward ratio what was the wind loss I have to do this much uh if you want to be a billionaire perhaps otherwise uh shortcut any shortcut no penny stocks short stock I'll tell you the shortcut mini stocks buy nifty50 and create a sip and do it for 20 years that's the shortcut so after you have the back test you'll also be able to get stuff like draw down and when will you start trading once you know the draw down what if I told you you could lose half of your Capital say again you could lose half of your Capital H you'll know draw down which is the worst case scenario your system went through so you have to find some system that works usually the simpler ones work best um and and then you'll know how much trade so yeah I'll do it all right perfect um and then finally we have stuff like um we've discussed trading time frame this is important right so scaling Capital position sizing over trading people like you will do this a lot which is over trading is when you go beyond the strategy so if you have a strategy like ENT exit are sir okay I'll add this also H now this Jenga block has become like your trading career which is looks really good but actually there's no Foundation only why is it still standing boy because overconfidence so now let's imagine that you start to over trade this is the money that I'm making and you take one trade over here you get a stop loss you take another trade it's my money you take another trade over here and there's a stop loss and you finally take another trade over here over [Music] here so I think this is the problem right you want to make a lot of money right billionaire yeah so there's these super smart people who started this hedge fund um long-term Capital Management and they did exactly this they had all these things but they took one really bad trade they were in bonds and that one trade actually broke everything and they went bankrupt Point number two don't listen to your emotions because if you do what makes you feel you happen yeah actually you should join meditation class and just calm down trading is actually a longterm activity and you need a lot of patience for a to work and when will this give me money at least 10 years are you willing to put in 10 years trading is like any other skill it'll take 10 years okay that was easy so like any other skill learn it start with small Capital main capital is in long-term investing done figured out back testing we can keep discussing back testing okay we'll eventually do it okay don't listen to your emotions follow the plan and uh we keep playing games and figuring out your trading Journey thank you so much if you found this useful and think that you are also an abishek type I will change my trading plan and or I will find a trading plan in the comments below and I will see you in the next episode tell us what other trading psychology or investing psychology we should pick up that we can learn with abishek over here and um I hope you enjoyed this see you in the next episode very important I want to make money of course you do 1,000 rupees 10,000 rupees drop off okay let me explain it in your vulgar language 10 seconds [Laughter] perform",

basically you'll make money only if the market goes up a lot up a lot or down a lot a lot and you lose money if the market stay if the market goes but got it okay and you spent and your investment your trade amount was your option correct oh that's the problem call option went from 140ish all the way to 30 seconds this is I don't know and it got stopped out stop and what about your put because Market is going up and you're losing money on it so now you're not trading a straddle anymore I don't know what I'm trading guys this is the problem option trading has a lot of nuances we don't understand so that you don't have to face this again before we start hit that like hit that subscribe okay here's what you [Music] do no I want to see a trade first tell me why are you trading options man because it will make me Rich now yeah boy okay see you get you get leverage which is you can control I can control a large cont cont correct second is cost Effectiveness so you think with 10 20,000 rupes you can start trading H correct I can start trading cost or risk I have I have anide lose I lose this you think because you're buying x amount in options maximum loss is I don't think [Music] or do you know why options exist meat thals an ancient philosopher with the knack for astronomy mathematics and creating the first options contract by predicting a bumper Olive Harvest he basically secured the rights to Olive presses ahead of time for a small fee and when the Harvest was abundant he foresaw that everyone would need the olive presses which he had the rights to so he sold those rights at a higher price making a tidy profit the clever move was essentially the birth of a call option where one pays for the right but not the obligation to use something at a predetermined price and well at a predetermined time fast forward to the 17 century in Holland and we encounter these tulips and the tulip bulb Mania tulips were all the rage and were actually a status symbol people Ed tulips to show how Elite they are in society as the price for tulips soared the price for tulip bulbs and their options also soared a secondary market for these options emerged allowing even ordinary folks to speculate on tulip prices unfortunately like all bubbles this one burst as well and caused Financial ruin for all these guys The Fallout was so bad that options trading was banned in many places for a long time then the real game changer came with the establishment of Chicago Board options Exchange in 1973 and these guys standardized option trading and introduced a regulated Marketplace what what was cooler is that someone created the black schs pricing model a formula that could calculate the fair price of an option and this helped market gain liquidity and trust and people started using it more today options trading is a bustling activity with millions of contracts traded daily and India has become one of the largest markets too facilitated by a lot of online trading platforms now there are some risks to this which we'll talk about but from Tails Olive presses all the way to the dynamic world of options today so much has happened an GRE yeah I mean sort of I guess the idea started there but now it's more formalized to options purpose was never to trade it was to hedge and you know in January 2023 there was a paper by sebbi Seb regulator sebbi talked about this let's open it up I'll show it to you okay I've sent it h this one so yeah let's the first part is on client participation so you can see that they saying the total number of unique individual traders who traded in the top 10 Brokers fno was 45 lakh in fy22 oh oh These are unique okay up from 7 lakh in fy19 so that's a 500% increase a lot of people are trading options and 88% were active Traders between the age group of 30 and 40 and obviously male dominant ated greater than 80% the second part is about loss makers and profit makers and this is by sebbi right so they're saying 89% of individual Traders that's 9 out of 10 in equity incurred losses with an average loss of 1.1 lakh the average active Trader lost 1.1 lakh in fy22 in fno and 90% of active Traders encouraged a uh incurred a loss of 1.25 lakhs in the same period that's crazy right that M so for the group of active Traders on average the loss makers registered a n a net trading loss of 50,000 Rupees and then let's look at the profit right the profit is the best part right so profit makers in F22 11% of traders made a profit with an average of 1.5 lakh roughly so one that's not very significant two only a small portion of people have made money from it so do you think making money from fno is an easy thing no and also the top 1% of the active Traders accounted for 51 to 75% of the total net profit I have to be in that 1% bet let me explain the list of problems okay with options first year freak trades that stuff that you saw where the market just went down took your stop- loss out freak trades happen a lot which is when the market moves very quickly in One Direction maybe takes your stop loss out and goes back second stop loss it loss if that's happened to you put it in the comments below want to hear your story second is slippage slippage happens when you want to exit at 100 you're not getting the correct price but in options it's a little more because liquidity could be an issue then there is this new dimension of time with options options strike price then there's the problem of margin that 10,000 could become zero out of the money dude the problems are unlimited because you are only looking at the rewards there are issues because you don't understand how options work clearly people can make a profit but it's really tough problem liity of the mtion I hate options no you don't understand it yet so solution then problem I don't think you should leave it uh what you should do is to exit that uh H exit that trade that you were telling me about okay so you get out of that first though I think you should learn options there are a lot of there are a lot of places you can learn options you should check out Varsity you can read about it you can watch the video and once you understand it you'll understand different dimensions of options so I think that's one second make sure you plan your trade you know plan your entry plan your exit uh know how much you can lose and we always say this but I'll say it again here's a list of things you need to do before you even think about trading let alone options third once you understand all this you will have the right psychological makeup to even think about trading I would like you to change this to monthly and zoom out and see why people who have monly minute changes to monthly monthly and zoom out and see that if you are a large investor with a decent portfolio with a a nice investment with a nice investment in stocks and then after that you want to do options perhaps that's a better way to think about it because if you just do options you'll just be scared all the time and you'll wet your pants you don't understand options were not meant to create consistent income it wasn't even created for the stock market options were hedging Hing it was Commodities it was for you can just look at that Index Fund is what you should be looking at okay sir it's not possible unless you put too much effort you'll have to learn a lot to okay sir I'll just just exit this trade option if you don't understand it just don't do it guys if you found this episode useful we talked about options this time more on the psychology side let me know what you think thank [Laughter] youy see you in the next video and like subscribe share you can share the link WhatsApp this [Music] is it will make me Rich sorry D just say bro trade [Music] with I cannot do that scene again I cannot do that",

guys won't tell you but before we start hit that like And subscribe let's start with step number [Music] one imagine getting up one day and looking through Finance Twitter seeing that they've made 1 CR rupees these unknown Traders you've never heard of are making tons of money you could only dream of but you you're not even close your salary doesn't come close your trading sucks and you need a way to get out of this Rabbit Hole you need a savior this savior not only promises you great consistent profits because he himself is doing it he's also like a big brother/sister looking out for you taking care of you helping you and you feel you should join his community and somehow become like this person like any getrich quick scheme whether it's the lottery MLM or this the promise is always promised land cors of rupees in the future if you just do blah blah blah and hey I'm here to help you this is the problem with this entire setup it's probably not true so let's understand what is pnl how p&l can be faked what's verified pnl and possibly how people can game verified p&l as well so profit and loss is very simple when you're trading you're buying you're selling you buy at 100 you sell at 102 it's a 2 rup profit multiplied by the number of shares do this again and again over a period of time you end up with a profit or a loss but there are a bunch of other costs as well there is tax there's brokerage there is slippage and a bunch of other things if you add all of that as well you get a loss a lot of Traders face this and when you see a Trader making a lot of profit it's kind of intriguing exciting and the promised land feels very close by so let's download a pnl and see how this works all I need to do is go to any broken terminal and uh go to the back office and click on and click on reports right here and I have pnl now I'll choose Equity combined for a date range let me just choose entire FY the report will get generated and I can see that I have all these months over here November December January February March the greens show the days I actually made a profit the Reds show the days I made a loss and then I can see the charges and taxes and net realized pnl and unrealized pnl realized pnl is once you've closed a position if you bought and then sold and you have a net position that made a profit or loss that's shown over here then there's unrealized pnl where maybe you have an open position not closed yet and that's showing that unrealized pnl over there that's right here so now what I'll do is I'll download this entire Excel sheet so I get get the entire dump on Excel and I can actually see all the traits here it's downloading and it's opened up perfect now you'll notice um I can actually enable editing and I can show this pnl report to anyone like my friends or possible customers and uh impress them with my amazing skills but you see um over here I'm not making a lot of profit one thing I can do is actually edit this and change change the realized pnl to 1 CR rupees all I need to do is take a screenshot of this and send it across or just send the Excel sheet to the unsuspecting customer to show him how much money I've made but this is a little old school Excel sheet edit Kaa doesn't sound too fancy does it another fancy way of doing this is to open your broker terminal and this works with any broker all I need to do is open the existing broking account go to positions and see what trades I have I can see my trade over here and you can see I'm not really making a profit but because Chrome browser or any browser is a front end basically showing what's come from the back end all I need to do is edit that front end so I'm not really editing the broker here I'm editing what the user what I see on my browser so I can right click click on inspect element click on the element I want to change make this one GR rupes and hit enter now notice this looks pretty real especially if I take a screenshot and post it but the data is still coming from the back end so if I click anywhere else or refresh the page that data will be gone but the screenshot looks really impressive this too does not work really well over the long term because people don't expect screenshots to be real in fact there was a time when everyone believed screenshots I mean screenshot is is real it looks exactly like the broken terminal but soon people caught up this was all Finance Twitter was talking about that the screenshot is fake you could Photoshop it you could get a bunch of graphic designers to change it or you could just inspect element and change the data on the spot the problem was not that these people are doing this for reputation the problem is when someone tries to use a fake p&l to sell a dream the dream that they are really successful and you need to pay them money to become as successful as them remember that's the problem if someone's doing this for fun in games it wouldn't have mattered but this can be financially injurious to users because they're just being defrauded to take money from them it's not good so now when I change inspect element I can actually click around and when I click around new data comes from the broker and the profits gone so I can't really record my screen as a video and share it with them because that felt the most authentic so there's no way to do that right right right there's no way to do that but there is let me show you a secret telegram group in this telegram group over here it's called zeroa fake app or any other broker fake app and you can actually download you pay them 200 or 300 rupees and you can actually download this app which looks exactly like the broker app but there is a back end for you to put the buy and sell and as soon as you've done this you can see this example in Bank Nifty that he's done and once he hits enter this is what the app looks like look at that it looks real and over here you can do screen recording you can click around and the position also changes you'll notice that the price profit is actually changing it looks exactly like the broker now gullible people were looking at this and saying it's not a screenshot it's not an Excel sheet it's a video it's an actual app that he's opening this must be true but there was one more thought a good friend of mine Abid from sensible last year 2022 introduced something called verified pnl where you would basically connect your broking account to this app and it would verify whether there's a profit or a loss from the broker back end and give you a link now this link is not an image it's not an Excel sheet it's not a video it's an actual web page and that web page is getting data directly from the broker and because of that you can actually see whether there's an actual profit or loss now it's straightway transparent data that you can actually see and a lot of Brokers now have their own verified pnls so anyone wanted to share their profit and loss for whatever reason there is a legitimate way to actually show a verified pnl so basically if you go to a broker now and you have an account you go to the back office click on account account go down there's verified pnl I can choose my full name I can change it I can make it masked I can use an afar I can choose what I want to show Equity currency Futures options commodity so I'll let that be and I'll keep this 30 days I can also see if I can keep a live p&l so this updates every day but I'll choose not to do that and I'll click on Save and I have a link now this is what makes it interesting There's an actual link to it so when I go and click on the link this this opens up over here and we can see there it is so this is a verified p&l of this person and this verified web page is what makes it real because this data is coming directly from the broker's back end it's not an image it's not an Excel sheet it's not an app it's not a video it's an actual web page anyway the problem over here is not fake p&l statements or a business or a book The problem is that people are asking you to do something something by dating you with greed so if you want to take a course take it because you want to learn how something works not because you'll make one CR in 6 months if you want to start a small business start that small business to learn how that business works not to make one CR in 3 months if you want to read a book because it teaches something read a book but not because it'll make you one CR in a month so don't do it for greed do it for knowledge do it for increasing skill set do it for learning something brand new and improving yourself and you should be completely fine now this is not new there's always a old perfume in a new bottle there may be different ways people will lure you through Greed for a short period we had this there may be something else in the future and you should understand the basic patterns behind how all of this works it used to be called snake oil salesman way back now it's the same thing it just changed a little bit if you think we're doing a good job by De influencing some stuff people will fall for tell us what else topics we should pick up in the comments below share this with a friend so he also knows that this exists if you found this useful hit that subscribe and that like button and see you in the next episode road to riches but you know guys and I can choose what I want to show Equity I can choose I can choose what I want to I can choose what I want to show Equity currency Futures options commodity so I'll let that be",

    "transcript_full": "Friend, I need money, I need  loan. Maybe there's an app? So many apps? And you will get instant loan? Let's apply for the loan. Allow, Allow. Money also received? So easy! Hey man! Return my 70 thousand rupees. Oh hey, talk properly. I had taken only Rs 50 thousand Oh hey, Smarty! As for your Rs 50 thousand... what do you think, we all are sitting  just like this? I will not pay this much interest, this is fraud! Son, I own your life. Whatever you allowed in the apps, messages, phone number, gallery, I can access all of them. This, this is blackmail. No, it's an epidemic. Today we've picked a most serious topic and it's on loan apps. And I'm also not gonna ask you to Like and Subscribe. Instead, this time I am gonna ask you, please share this video with 2 people because I think it could save someone's life. So, let's begin. Now taking loan from any app is not wrong. You get credit from that app and maybe you can use it for something you really need it for. The problem is that that app is illegal. It is not approved by RBI and is basically fraud. Because of this they can charge high interest, can ruin you financially and in some cases can even take someone's life. And I am not exaggerating over here, see this is the data of last three years, these are all the complaints against loan apps. There used to be some 30,000 in 2020 and this has gone all the way to 76,000 and you know these are the numbers which are reported. There must be so many unreported numbers, that we probably can't even count them. Apart from this, you are thinking that this is not a matter of ten or twenty lakhs. Hundreds of crores is being recorded here and people's lives are being ruined. And the worst part, is that 60 people have lost their lives because of the harassment. Now everyone is playing their part. The government is creating rules and regulations to curtail this. Places like the App store, Google Play are removing these apps so that no one else downloads them. But we should also play our part. We need to know how this works, so that you and your friends don't get caught in this. So what we will do is understand this entire modus operandi, from step 1 all the way till harassment and will take out their red flags one by one and understand where you can be alert. And where can you know that maybe there is something wrong. So let's start with step number 1. First of all you will download any app from the App Store, if you have Apple or the Play Store if you have Android. Now here you will see many nice, interesting apps like this 100% genuine. Loan app, or this one, this is not a scam.Loan app, or this one, Give me money now. Loan app. We will select 1 of these humble looking apps and download it. After downloading, you will see this flash screen, welcoming you into this beautiful world. And here you will be asked for some permissions like allow contacts, give permission to read messages, maybe you will also be asked for permission of gallery. Now to enter, as you need money, you allow all permissions and you enter the application. Now you have entered this app and you have to select how much loan do you want? So, suppose here we fill fifty thousand rupees and after this there are two check marks. Look a little carefully, there are some terms and conditions. Seems quite long. Let's skip this, must be fine. And we will click 'Okay' and enter our bank account details and hit done. Something's loading. Hey, the money has arrived, we now have access to that 50000 rupees and it is real money, it has been verified in my account. So this was the procedure. 61 Nice, simple, fast and amazing. First red flag, When we were looking for an app, we found it by searching like this. When you click on an app, the first thing you have to find out behind every app is a company. Is that company approved by RBI? Do they have a license? Are they actually under the scrutiny of the Reserve Bank of India. Now this will not be available in the app, so you simply have to go to,’About Us,’ and find out the name of their company. If they don't reveal the name of the company, that's a huge red flag. If they do tell you, then simply go to RBI's website. In RBI website under this section you will find an excel sheet. We have also included excel sheet in the description also for your ease. So you can see this. There are two excel sheets here. First excel sheet,where the names of all those people are given, to whom RBI has given license for lending. So you will see Bajaj Finance here, you will see the names of banks here. These are legitimate organizations, which are connected with RBI via a proper license. In the second excel sheet, RBI maintains a list of all those companies that it has banned. So if you find your company in the banned list, you obviously know something is wrong. And if you don't find your Loan app company in the proper license list that is also not good. So first things first, Promise before you do any financial transaction, you are doing it with an approved RBI company. Let's see the next red flag and in this you will see that when we opened the app, this app started asking something. Now why is a financial company asking for your contact list, permission to read your SMS and access to your gallery. Please be very careful. You can't give this personal information to someone you don't know. Imagine you are walking down the street and a random person comes to you and says, ‘Hey brother! What's going on? You say ‘Everything is fine! He says,’ do one thing, transfer all the photos in your gallery from the last ten years and your messages to me, also send me the entire contact list with names. Will you give this information to such a random person on the street? Then why would you give it, when you are downloading an app? So next time you get a pop up asking for permissions, be very very carefu,l whether you want to hit that allow button or cancel and delete the app. Then comes the third red flag. Paperwork. Remember that there are KYC norms as per the government i.e. know your customer. Especially in Financial organizations, wherever you open a broking account, open a bank account, or take a loan, In these financial transactions the company has to know the client and it has some basic requirements. It could be your Aadhaar and other documents which are written here. In this situation, when we were downloading the app and requesting to withdraw money, they did not follow,’ Know Your Customer.’ Neither took my Aadhaar, nor took any information, nor took PAN card, this is a big problem. Apart from this, there is also a second problem. The second problem is that there was no Loan Agreement. There  were just a bunch of Terms and Conditions to check, but this makes no sense. If you go to a proper bank and take a loan, there is a proper Loan Agreement, that specifies the terms of the Loan, Disbursement, Closure etc. Without the Loan Agreement, don't know what just happened. And there's another red flag, 'Instant Transfer.’ Now again there is nothing wrong with instant transfer. This is basically if KYC is done and it is a proper NBFC company and all your documentation is in order, disbursement can happen in minutes. And I think some apps also do this which are recognized. But when an illegal, unrecognized app gives you money immediately without doing any paper work, that is a problem and this is also a red flag. Then comes interest rate. And look, this is a red flag generally, but in this case it is a little more red and a little more interesting because these Loan apps are very clever. Here are the Terms and Conditions that we checked. Now see, its ten percent interest here. Now ten percent is enough. Ten percent for one year. Sir, it is not yearly interest. Then? It is monthly interest. What are you sayingt? Monthly? 124 Ten percent monthly compounded. Wow! This obviously means that if you have taken a loan of one lakh, then it can be 100, 200, 300 percent per year by adding compounding. And this is a huge problem. Ignore everything else, just that crazy interest rate means you will turn to financial ruin. If all these red flags weren't enough, let's rewind to the start of this video, where this guy had applied for a 50,000 rupee loan and actually got 40,000. Did you notice that? Why did he get 40,000 if you applied for 50K? Well, the 10,000 was actually hidden charges. You know, application form charge, tea charge, coffee charge, ‘you are living, and I don't like you,’ charge etc. And because of that he actually got only 40K. What's worse is that your interest is being calculated on 50,000. I’ll say it once again. Took a loan of fifty thousand, got forty thousand but interest is being charged on fifty thousand. Monthly, compounded. Don't do it, friend. Please share this video with two people so that everyone knows that loan apps are not the way, try something else. This is the problem. So don't think that two or four people are harassing some people sitting in their bedrooms. This is a proper organized unit of people with hierarchy to scale the business. And I think it has better margins too. Unfortunately. Here is what it looks like. There is an actual hierarchy. There is a corporate trainer who actually trains them how they should talk? Again excellent work done by this BBC documentary where he is explaining. After the training, the callers have also been professionally trained, he talks like this. There is no need for etiquette because that is not the strategy. The strategy is to scare. And its not like, these people call you just once or twice. It’s possible that you get thirty, forty messages and phone calls in a day. This is called,’ Harassment. We'd also like to salute this lady for coming out in the open and explaining how she was a victim. 156 We all got to learn something through her story and honestly when we were watching this in the office we were shocked. She was targeted by one of these Loan apps and a morphed photo was sent to everyone in her office. And I am sure this was one of the worst times and I don't wish anyone to go through something this bad. But we are bringing it back, so you can know how serious this can get. Her life was spoilt, we probably can't even imagine her mental harassment, because one day she went to the office and her boss called her and said that everyone has received a morphed photo of yours on WhatsApp. What's going on? How embarrassing, how bad and so unnecessary. Please watch the full documentary. Link is in the description. The name of that Loan app was, 'Asan Loan'. If you went through an illegal, unauthorized Loan app, please share your experience in the comments, so that we can learn from each other. And then we have this sad tale, where a 22 year old took his own life and left this note saying he cannot pay the amount he took from a Loan app and he had to commit suicide. Remember, they're targeting those who are financially a little weak in their phase of life. Maybe ther are not receiving their salary on time, maybe there is no job, maybe there is a great need of money right now and there is no way of earning, there is no savings, they are facing issues financially, which is why they take the loan. So it is very difficult to repay and there is only one way to bring it back. 'Shame’ Because they have your data, they will use shame to extort the money out of you, at crazy interest rate levels. If something like this is happening to you or someone you know, then first of all do not be afraid. First of all put it in the comments. Let people know that something like this is happening. Second, launch an official complaint. By dialling this number, you can report cyber crime actually, telling what happened with you. Remember the Indian government is very serious when it comes to crimes like this. You will be helped. If you don't want to call, you can go to this website and fill a form and file a proper complaint. The cyber crime unit's job is to solve cyber crime. So they understand the nuances that what problems can arise online and how you are affected. So they understand this, that is why a separate cell has been created called the ‘Cyber Crime Unit.’ Please use it. Indian government recognizes this problem. They know what online fraud looks like. What is Exorbitant Interest Rates? What are unrecognised Illegal apps? You just have to deliver the information to them. And that is the most important step. You don't have to be afraid! This is the check list. Pause the video now, take a screenshot of this check list, double triple check if you are taking loans from anyone so that something like this does not happen to you. Please share this video with two people so that we can tell people  that this happens, and is very dangerous. And finally if you liked the episode and you want us to make more such episodes, then please write in the comments so that we can know, that this hard work of ours did not go to waste, and this was useful to you. If you liked this video please tell us. Hit the Like, hit the Subscribe. And see you in the next episode.",

    "transcript_full": "well he's doing what he does so well he's just trying to relax the baller get his field in exactly the right place I've made the best team I could have made it's a good team all I need to do is win this and once I win I'll make two L and all my problems all my losses will be recovered I in second position if he hits a six on the next ball I'll I'll win the game he'll bowl a short ball find like Fielder is outside the circle but the mid on Fielder is inside he bow a Yer no shot ball no no no Yer short ball Yer oh God he bow a Leng ball in the air man out there is he over his head I think it is Mo right on the edge India win the most amazing series by playing magnificent [Applause] Cricket something was definitely wrong here I mean this guy is unhappy even though India won because he lost money in fantasy Sport and like him cors of Indians lose money a little bit every day and crads of Indians think that they can earn or win that one CR rupees so we have these games coming up the Copa America the euros and T20 so we thought fantasy sports going to be a little hot and it could be injurious to your financial health so we thought we'll de influence it in this episode we'll talk about the good and the bad cuz clearly no one else will tell you let's [Music] begin namaskar Samar give me the news so we have ricksha driver wins 1.5 CR in fantasy sport app bear man wins 1.5 CR in fantasy sport app again eighth grade Dropout wins 1.5 CR on a cricket fantasy sport app despite having no knowledge of cricket now reading news like this you'll think damn I should also play this game and maybe I can win something in fact there are a lot of winners who win 1 LH 50,000 5 lakhs and it feels ke some friend of friend earned it and this game of skill is really interesting now I agree it is interesting but there's also another side can I have the other side the headlines say cricket fan on platform loses 70,000 Rupees to fraudsters Fantasy sport apps Indians have new online gaming addiction and they are losing big youth loses cousins 2.6 lakh rupees on an app for fantasy sports then calls Merit police to say he was robbed and then we have posts on Reddit and Twitter people talking about how they've lost lacks and lacks of rupees on fantasy sport remember I'm not saying fantasy sport is bad it's it's your behavior on an app that feels so thrilling that compels you to make you lose lacks of rupees when it was just a game for entertainment only and that's what it's built for so let's understand how fantasy sport actually works it's pretty simple it's a fantasy let's suppose we have T20 upcoming and there is a match happening tomorrow all you need to do is create a set of 11 players from those 22 players now remember you have created your own team this team doesn't exist you who selected the team now when the match is actually going on based on actual performance you will get points based on how your team performs and the team that wins which could be your team captures the grand prize wait before getting to the grand prize let me explain how the business model works so like I said let's suppose that we have an actual match happening tomorrow and you've created your 11 Loca team actually now this 11 team will actually get points based on and what's happening in the real world so you'll watch the actual match but to enter this you have to enter a contest for tomorrow's match there will be hundreds of contests running all with different amounts to enter so let's suppose I pick the one which is Affordable 50 rupees and I can see one and a half CR people are participating in this one contest and I also enter by putting just 50 rupes but the interesting thing is that the first price over here is 1 CR rupes which means by simply spending 50 rupees to enter the contest enjoying the match and if I win I could win 1 CR rupees nice and the business model is pretty simple this is how you can win how does the fantasy sport app win very simply from the total prize pool which is all the people participating multiplied by the 50 rupees you come to a prize pool now of course GST V all that will remove but what's left of it over there 15 to 20% is taken by the platform it's a simple platform fee which seems a little high 15 20% not bad and the money that's left over is divided amongst the winners simple so let's talk about probability numbers quantitative you know what I'm saying right contest I mean let's put some numbers to it and understand how much money we can actually make so the probability catch of you winning is actually really low like me if I play the chances of me hitting that ball is 100% yeah sir half the time you missed the ball take 50% but anyway 50% is not bad the question is what are the chances of you winning an actual contest so first you have to select players now the rules state that you can't select all players from one team there has to be four from each team at least then you can create now if you do the math this is about 6.5 lakh combinations of different teams that can be built that's a lot got 6.5 lakh combinations then we also have one more variable which is selection of the Vice Captain and the captain now if you add that that's about 110 variations so if you multiply these two combinations you get wait for it 7.1 CR combinations crazy now let's talk about the probability of you winning like my hit rate of the bat and the ball is they got it's 100% but tell over a period of time it's 50% the chances of you winning is basically you that's one divided by all the people in the contest that's 1.5 crores it's basically 0.0000 6 something something per. to put this into perspective the chance of you getting hit by lightning is 10 times more than you winning that contest so the chances of you winning probabilistically is really low and and I think this is why so many people end up losing so much money because they don't understand the probability of winning actually the probability of lost all they see is I'm losing 50 rupees I could make so much let's do it so why are people actually playing if so many people are losing so much there must be something to it right so I think there are two aspects the first is what if I told you spend 50 rupees for a contest and have the chance to make 1 CR rupees you'll do it n it sounds interesting and once you start you feel that you were close and you feel maybe I should have made a better selection I'll try once more and then you try again but at some point you may think that these numbers right of 1.5 CR people playing is too much so let's enter a contest there are only 10 people that's right 10 people so the probability of you winning has increased a lot because you are one there are nine other people there only 10 people in that contest so the probability of you winning is not 0.0000 whatever it's much better they're only 10 people because the probability went up the price money changed too it's not one or 2 CR rupees it's not even 1 lakh in this case it's only 50,000 so now you tell me even if you lost over here you would actually lose the entire amount of 10,000 rupees your probability may have gone up but your reward is also low now it's really important to understand the psychology of the play who's playing the fantasy sport so let's go in his shoes a little bit and I want to show you a little bit of my Cricket skills okay nice second ball thanks guys third [Music] ball not bad fourth catch me fifth [Music] ball that honestly feels really good and this is exactly what what happens when you play a fantasy sport so you start off by creating a first team you maybe spent 50 rupees on the first Contest no big deal to create that team you go into the saber metrics into the metrics of the batting the opener the pitch the location the mood what's happening you look at the fastest Bowlers the slower Bowlers The Spinners and you create the perfect team you feel like Professor creating not the power of girls but your team and you are slightly proud of it because you put so much effort and time into it this is also called sunken cost and you feel you feel something is beautiful because you created it you built this team this is your team and you're really proud of it when you're actually watching the game the thrill goes up the ball goes and you were right the spinner did make that other guy go bold and you got those points and you ask your friend rank your rank is slightly better maybe your skill is better and G say if you're able to earn 70 rupees from that 50 you feel maybe you have an knack for this maybe you're smart maybe this can be something that you can pursue more long term it's also good for the game because there was a delight study which said people who play these games actually watch and enjoy the game even more so the ecosystem is growing and to be honest sports is good health is good what's not good is the addiction to all of this with respect to money and this is why why so many people lose lacks of rupees because they lose a little bit of control remember it's just a game guys so why aren't these apps banned well first of all these apps are not betting they're considered a game of skill because they don't have a binary outcome they're not saying either this or that there are multiple combinations that have to be built which require some skill and only certain people win so it's not considered betting by the government so therefore the government defines this as a game of SK kill and because of this companies aggressively Market this product and they spent 5,000 CR rupees in fy22 think about it 5,000 crores being influenced to you to ask you to play the game because it's damn good and because there's so much demand so many people want to play YouTubers also come into the picture which create videos talking about their best team the best team that's possible the analysis Etc so people get caught up in this content conundrum where they're learning about new things not only this there are companies websites where you can pay a subscription fee and get information paid information on what is the best combination of a team to be built so there is so much around to support these players to stay in the game it's just freaking crazy and I have to talk about productivity right productivity see this I found an interesting thread on Reddit where someone says I work from home and definitely decreases my produ productivity in the job I do I spend hours and hours during work hours creating my fantasy sport this is a guy creating fantasy football in the US and there are a bunch of people below it saying LOL this is also me other people saying that they're spending hours and hours during office just doing this in fact it says 96.6% of fantasy football players in the US admit to devoting workers to their virtual teams and this amounts to $16 billion of productivity lost as a Founder I disapprove of this very bad I'm not sure if the same thing is happening in India as well but at least around me I can see that a lot of people are interested in it and it does go into some productive hours the thing about these apps is and I'm talking about all of these apps globally is that they give you the illusion of control which means they give you data points stats you have strategies online you have proof you have numbers and it feels like you can control the game if you understand it and iterate over your strategy and because it feels like you are in a game of skill you feel like at some point you'll get so good at it you can actually earn from it and not just win from it once you understand what illusion of control is maybe you'll find a way to segregate between just enjoying the fantasy sport app if you do so or just enjoying the game and hopefully never getting addicted to it if I miss something please put it in the comments below and say de influencing Army let me know what we should do next and see you in the next episode we have bloopers coming up [Music] to Fantasy [Music] [Applause]",

    "transcript_full": "as soon as a kid gets great marks in class 10 we say science meow engineering you'll get status you'll get money the world will be at your feet but is that really the case I don't think the problem is with engineering it's the expectation Society has parents has and even sometimes the student has for doing engineering so in this episode let's talk about the good and the bad of the expectations of society and parents for engineering let's get started [Music] [Music] so we're not de influencing engineering we're actually de influencing the expectations Society has and parents have thinking that the best career option out there is only engineering I mean think about it if a student is really good at studies in 11th everyone will tell him influence him push him to actually take science so all the options are actually open and because engineering seemingly feels like the best option out there in terms of salary and Status everyone's pushed towards it so this episode is not about engineering as a career it's more to do with everyone's expectations but why is engineering so hyped in India ever since the British came to India Engineers were always respected I mean think about it all the infrastructure was created by these people and they had some respect in society I mean they were building the nation and as Indians joined the job of being an engineer they also carried the same Prestige these guys build railroad infrastructure Etc so there must be respect and it was a technical job and think about it at that time there weren't a lot of Engineers and anything that's scar always has value as the britishers left India after Independence we were left with the engineers we had but it wasn't enough we needed more because the entire country needed to get upgraded needed to be built and reach where we are today and our former prime minister jaal Neu created these four iits because of the development boom India was heading towards and the growth we were experiencing Engineers were highly sought after and the four iits weren't enough to fulfill the demand and what happens when we have a lot of demand and less Supply the job isn't just a job it becomes a prestigious job something that everyone's talking about there is respect people people who are Engineers are actually sought after paid really well get all these perks other people don't then in the 1990s we had the digital Revolution all the way up to 2000 and the burst which we've talked about so many times in this decade we really needed Engineers Engineers around data it networking you name it and India was poised at this particular place we were an english- speaking Nation we had Engineers we also had a lot of programmers at that time and and we produced it the culture actually moved towards engineering so a lot of us and Europe companies wanted to hire from India because of the English because the salary expectations were low and of course we were great programmers the demand however followed an exponential curve which did not meet the growth of the number of seats in government colleges so what do we do to fill up that Gap we got thousands of private colleges and all these private colleges said do engineering from here we have the seats and you'll be set for life so engineering today is not as prestigious as it was 50 years ago and don't get me wrong it's not like we don't need Engineers everything that we see around us is built by Engineers but the problem is the demand and Supply on one side you have lacks of people graduating as Engineers every year and the demand for it is not as much so let's decode the life of an engineering aspirant and see what issues they actually face the first pressure sensory experience our je aspirant has is to get into a nice coaching class because once you get into a nice coaching class you can get into IIT and the place to actually go is Kota every year three lakh students go to Kota stay there with an aspiration to get into IIT the fees over here is 1.5 lakh rupees per year on average so the pressure begins first the pressure around you you're looking at everyone all these people want to be engineers and your day is surrounded by just getting into IIT a friend of mine told me that there's a building where they stay mess then they go down to actually sleep and study attend classes and go up and in that building is where their entire life resides and the batch they're allotted to is based on how smart they are so the smartest batch will go in a certain class and the not so smart batch will go in another class so all the best teachers will go to class A and not so best teachers will go over here this itself is a huge problem because mentally you start thinking I've lost the battle even before you've given the exam iits have 177,000 seats I want you to imagine this number a little bit 17,000 seats in the entire country now I'm going to count up okay count with me 177,000 50,000 1 lakh 1 lakh to 2 lakh 3 lakh 4 lakh 5 lakh 6 lakh 7 lakh 8 lakh 9 lak 10 lakh 11 lakh 12 lakh that's how many people attempt to get those 177,000 seats that's only a 1.5% acceptance rate I'll say this again 12 lakh people giving the exam to actually get 177,000 seats is it really worth it but it's not only the 177,000 seats let's include some other colleges as well including the private ones maybe we have about 80,000 to one lakh good seats in the country now if you're playing a game where the acceptance rate is really low like getting into engineering unless you're getting into a really good college outside of this they will not have a lot of opportunities because if you look at the data 15 lakh Engineers actually pass out and we know the high quality seats are roughly 50,000 to 1 lakh so what about the others those guys will suffer because they have the same expectation and this is the source of the disappointment Nasha they have after they graduate then we have private colleges some private colleges are really good and comparable to iits and nits but to get into them you need to crack a separate exam and if you look at the top 100 colleges only 14 of them are actually private but if you look at all of the colleges 90% of colleges are actually private now statistically speaking if the private colleges are not in the top 100 their fees should be less right of course their fees should be less but let's talk about fees the fees in private colleges is almost double it costs about 10 to 12 lakhs in an IIT and almost double in a private college now you tell me why is this the case demand it's because all of us talk about and say engineering and that's why they're able to have and charge such high fees the next problem is the forcible selection of a course so most people at least in India want to do csse computer science engineering and they do everything to get that seat but for whatever reason since there're not enough seats in csse they just don't get it instead they're forced to take something else like civil engineering mechanical engineering Electronics Etc even though they really wanted to get into csse now do you think a student who's trying to make his career and is going to work for the next 50 years should choose civil engineering over his love of say computer science assuming he likes computer science and he genuinely enjoys it why should he select something else other than that the next problem is actually getting employed and salaries so there was a survey done by nascom in 2019 which analyzed 15 lakh engineering graduates and saw that 2.5 lakh graduates actually get a job and the rest are unemployable now the reason could be that they don't have Real World skills or that there's just too much Supply but the fact is it is tough to get a job when so many people are vying for the same seat 2023 as we all know was not good for the economy and placements generally were low but for private colleges the fall in placements was 50 to 70% compared to iits where the fall was roughly about 30% so now let's talk about some solutions to be honest no one really has a solution because life changes so much let's start with you you are the natural product of really special circumstances that's got you here how your parents talked what things you watched what music you listened to the experiences you had the courses you did the good things that happened the bad things that happened brings you to actually a very unique position no one else in this world has your worldview your skills are truly unique but the society tries to specialize you in a particular kind of skill and that's the real problem I'll divide this into three parts [Music] the first part is this generally all of society will think of this curve right here when the Industrial Age happened everyone wanted Engineers everyone wanted hard labor everyone wanted to get in a factory and get work done therefore discipline coming on time doing things in punctuation hard skills over soft skills really really mattered and as production went up in the Industrial Age the Next Generation always thought discipline going to office etc etc is important and became popular exactly like engineering exactly like mbaas exactly like everything else but as soon as this happens and there is too much Supply there is actually a fall in the cost that the manufacturer wants to spend so salaries actually falls because there's way too much Supply so what do you actually do about this the race is not to go after a specialized skill the race is to actually be your yourself so instead of thinking specialization which is this going really deep into one thing you actually want to do a t-shaped thing which means you understand one thing really well and then you understand some other things in Fair depth as well this t-shape was actually brought by this canvas called the t-shaped marketer where they said if you want to learn digital marketing a good way is to specialize in say SEO but also know a little bit of copy a little bit of perform Performance Marketing little bit of creative Etc and once you have this package this hybrid version of you actually does really well and this brings me to my third point which is the hobbyist career I was talking to Kash from zeroda and he said he only hires freshers I said why and he says all I do is check their GitHub and try to see which of these actually did this for a lot of fun the guys who on Saturday Sunday are sitting in building stuff not to get a job but because they actually enjoy it and those people will actually survive because this is what life looks like you'll have periods of nothingness and then a spike periods of nothingness and then a spike now imagine if you're sitting in a job which you actually don't like skills that you don't want and you're going through say 3 years of nothingness will you actually survive it a lot of people will switch to a different different kind of job with a different skill set different industry and the entire problem of compounding becomes negative over here what you want in summary is this be yourself be a t-shaped marketer or have t-shaped skills stuff that you like and really specialize in one thing but know a lot of other things in your industry and three if you can do this for a really long period of time even when it gets boring you'll be fine because you genuinely enjoy it you'll actually win in life",

    "title_current": "Is freelancing better than full-time? | De-influencing",
    "transcript_full": "[Music] okay something is definitely wrong here I mean we think of corporate jobs as lifeless boring and just plain old tough and we think as freelance has this beautiful job where you wake up and you feel like work when you feel like and enjoy your damn life but maybe the grass is always greener on the other side and maybe there's something here that no one's really talking about I mean look at all these videos on the internet where they're talking about how freelances easy money anyway like we always do at this de influencing episode we'll talk about the good and the bad about freelancing cuz clearly the internet may be misguiding you so let's begin so there's nothing wrong with freelancing in fact freelancing is actually a really good option but the problem is people talk about a secret way to make cash that's making so much money with so much ease that it's almost like passive income and that's the problem so let's start with why do people not like jobs so first is you need relevant job experience I mean any corporate says experience then you will qualify for the interview but if you're a fresher the fresher definition means you don't have experience and if you don't have experience then how will you get in the corporate so this is a problem then there's the application process and actually networking so you have to go and create an account apply to multiple jobs clear a bunch of interviews this is obviously a lot of work for an on-site job you may have to switch your City to actually well work in that company and if you use that of course lifestyle and everything changes maybe if you're a fresher it's okay because the new experience is fun then there is that feeling you know that feeling when you're sitting on your desk staring into the abyss and thinking I think I'm underpaid I think I'm underappreciated why do I really come to office and what's the point of all of this and then you think what if I could do something more exciting what if I could freelance then happened Co it actually changed a lot of our mindset when you start thinking in a different way and at that time people were worried about their salaries to come and they lost their trust temporarily sh maybe my company may lay me off though I have to think of a backup and therefore I thought of freelancing so a lot of people actually went on Google and started searching freelancing and you can see here on Google Trends after covid there was a spike and it went flat after that because of this came the most interesting character Mr influencer Mr influencer makes all these videos and tells people how to make so much money in a short period of time with very little effort actually zero effort and that's the problem you cannot make money or anything in life or build anything in life with zero effort nothing comes easy the first misconception is that freelancing equals easy money so think about this as counterintuitive as it may sound when you start your freelancing career the first step is putting money in there is always an initial investment you have to do it could be a new graphics card a new computer could be a new vehicle that you have to travel with but there'll be some cost related to your craft because now you don't have a company to provide you with some basic infrastructure second is the opportunity cost as weird as this may sound the first few months you may not earn something because you have to build the website build the brand go and talk to a bunch of people clients usually will take their time because they're not in a hurry you are and for a couple of months if you don't earn you could have earned while you were in a job so take your salary multiplied by 6 months or 4 months and that's the period that you actually lost money and time not to mention a little bit of your confidence because it takes time to build something and finally there's low earnings when you start off things may seem really hunky and Dory you may have your first client second client right out of the bat but the earnings are low because this is new what you really need to focus on is getting those clients building recurring revenue and that takes time so your expectation should be time similarly if you work in a job you start thinking that your first salary your first month will be enough it won't your first year and two years are just to establish you so just like freelancing even in a job every year your skills compound the trust inside the company compounds and hopefully your salary also goes up with time so I want you to do an exercise it's a slightly biased exercise but let's go with the bias just for this find the top 50 companies in India and let's see what's the average pay of the CEO here is what the top 10 or top 20 look like notice this is the fixed pay some of them have added variable also now my question is I'm sure he's putting slightly less hours than you have but why is he earning so much and remember these names you see over here are not Founders they have not started the company and therefore H to make a lot of cash these people were hired their life was exactly like you but over a period of time they hit a point where they made all this money so this discussion isn't about being an employee versus freelancing it's about you do you really care about the skills that you have and are you really 2 Xing or 3 Xing those skills every year if yes then you have nothing to worry about whatever you do you'll be fine misconception two freelancing equals freedom of time now the expectation is very simple you're Your Own Boss you get to work when you feel like if you don't feel like working you don't and especially if you're a night alll if you feel like working at night you work at night there's no clock in clock out it's your freelancing project but the reality is slightly different inconvenient calls inconvenient timings now if you work for an international client you will be working at night and figuring your normal life out during the day that will mess up your biological clock not to mention your social life I'd also like to remind you there is no one in this world who does not have a boss whether you're a freelancer you have many whether you are a business owner you have investors even the investors may have raised money from LPS who also have bosses so everyone is accountable to someone there's nothing wrong with having a boss like look at this headline over here Elon is trying to negotiate a pay package with Tesla directors now we may think Elon must owner why does he have to negotiate because he has a board that decides things for him he also has a boss he just doesn't call it a boss he calls it a board of directors and then there's juggling between multiple clients let me explain how this works you have multiple clients to work with who will give you multiple deadlines with multiple payment Milestones that happen over multiple invoices that are paid over part invoice payments over the next few months you have to juggle all of that now that's not the problem the problem is for every piece of work you're doing you're being incentivized which means your brain will lie to your heart and your body that you can work a bit more in in fact the first one year will seem like a breeze you'll just keep working because you feel like every time you work you get paid very soon though you'll realize you've completely neglected your mental health and your physical health if you're a person who cannot balance this then freelancing is probably not for you the third misconception is that freelancing avoids office politics because there is no office you are your own boss and this expectation might have some interesting points well the first first is that you don't have to talk to your manager politely even though you really hate him and then talking to colleagues you don't like and the list goes on and sometimes the managers just don't see you you're like an invisible fly to them and you feel meaningless like what do I do so they notice me and politics is usually the answer gossiping and talking but as a freelancer this may not be true you see the reality is in both cases you're dealing with humans and humans people apes are political creatures they move ahead because there is hierarchy in a freelancing setting the same thing happens but the structures changed you now have clients at certain times you may not like the client of something he said the client may not like your work and he can get angry and upset with you and just say bad things to your face he doesn't have to sugarcoat it and this is completely fine because it's a client relationship as humans are itical creatures we're also social creatures I mean in an office there are water cooler moments there are times when you may have an offsite there may be some moments where you're spending time with your colleagues if you're a solo freelancer then you will face isolation I mean look at this story where a person says he feels like he has low energy doesn't feel like doing anything and he just doesn't have friends anymore because they're all working he can only meet them once or twice a month interacting and talking to people is a part of being a human of course we still have people who kill it with work from home and I'm sure some Freelancers can kill it too but if you are a social creature maybe being in isolation could be a problem the fourth misconception is that freelancing me getting a client is very easy no problem I mean one client should be easy right and after one comes two and after two I'll add the third then I'll do some marketing and double it to six income will also become six times but the reality is actually really different imagine this right you're in a market and this is an open market right now you're looking at multiple clients clients are looking at multiple Freelancers and clients not only have Freelancers they also have old employees existing employees people they want to promote other agencies companies small businesses large businesses and a freelancer which means you'll always be competing for every single Le job and in this competition an interesting thing happens in this post you can see that because of bandwidth issues a freelancer couldn't take up a really big client's work now that really big client just dropped out and said but now he lost that client and this and this is a problem where does he get his income from now and then of course sometimes a shitty company you're working for just may not pay so if you look at say upwork or Fiverr or any of these websites where you're trying to get some jobs and you type say video editor you'll get so many different jobs over here that the competition is intense and even if you do get one job the problem of recurring Revenue will always be there so there'll be no stability the truth is that you're watching this video and you actually care about money and your future I'm sure you must have some unique skill and if you don't you're developing it right now and over the next few years maybe a decade you'll get towards this and move away from this you're fine so tell me what you thought about this video write some experiences of your own life in the comments so we can learn from each other and if you have an interesting story to tell tag us on our Instagram Channel and we will feature it in our stories and see you in the next video bye-bye black offe wow that's such a pred thing to say

    "transcript_full": "today we're going to place abhishek's first live trade in options right now sir order place sir what what order placed how much was the order value sir 47700 wait and your entire Capital was how much 50,000 so hold up you placed your entire capital on one single trade in options right now let's see how this turns [Music] up wait wait why did you place that trade in the first place profits abish from bestell aims to become the next big option Trader and is performing these stuns here under the guidance of a professional don't try this at home without supervision so you think you'll be able to make some money see here's the problem U you put your entire capital in one single trade this opens up three issues first issue you can't take a second trade correct because your entire money is blocked and I'm assuming you have more money in your savings and FD and all of that separately right or pasina kamay everything is in the demat account I just playay oh no no please never do this so that's a second problem your entire savings is now in this one trade so if this option contract goes to zero and it can go to zero it's a option by contract so if it becomes out of the money and on expiry you don't do anything it'll go to zero how much money will you lose all it's not a trade you basically bet your entire life savings I think on this one single trade the other problem over here is leverage to um you bought how many shares like how many Lots four Lots so that's how many shares 200 so 200 shares Nifty so aot 50 um multiplied by what is the price of the of the option 23.8 231 right so roughly you spent about 47,000 on this mm right give give or take a few thousand roughly it's 47,000 but you're not actually controlling 47,000 worth of shares it is 200 multiplied by the price of the strike price what is the strike price over here you bought it at 19550 that's 391,000 oh leverage this is leverage basically the option gave you the right to buy this stock in this case index at 19550 and the the the amount you're controlling is 39 l ax versus the 47,000 premium you have actually paid so your pnl is actually going to be much much higher how much money are you making or losing right now so loss can I see please this is interesting you're already losing about 1,000 rupees on a 47,000 rupe investment and this could go to zero your 47,000 can become zero to 1,000 rupes divid by 47,000 is what is roughly you lost 2% % on your trade already and 2% of the premium that you've paid so the problem over here is that you're losing a lot of money because you think you only you've invested 47,000 no but it's highly leveraged and this will cause worry are you a little scared right now are you feeling a little anxious my life and it could become zero sir huh what am I supposed to do now are you nervous we can wait for this to go to zero it's minus 1500 rupees by the way now okay sorry what we'll do is uh we should exit this trade right now can you can you do an exit sure if you guys have any idea of what his plan should be please put it in the comments and abijit sorry abishek will tell you whether he likes that personal finance plan or not did you exit that great how much loss did you realize 1560 did you feel good about it of course not but with his loss hopefully you learned something okay but now this is out are you feeling better let me add one more thing I will send you this, 1560 rup you feeling okay you don't so you don't feel the losses what what am I supposed to do what is the initial amount you think or you know what is the amount that I should start trading with in the start so I think the question is how much Capital do I need to start trading with yeah that's the question so I think the first thing you need is trading is almost like a game actually it is a game you'll feel sad you'll feel scared then you exit you feel loss you feel remorse then people like me losses give you the profit so then you start feeling better did you see that entire you feel so good right now Beach me you had become you had shut up because you were scared this roller coaster you have to first negate all the fear the only way to remove fear is a three-step checklist and you should write this down look L I'll do it first figure out what your six Monon expenses jii what your six-month expenses and uh basically take your 1 month expense multiplied by 6 months ideally 12 months and have that in cash you can put this in a fixed deposit you can put this in a bond you can put it somewhere where it is Cash sir sir wait sir wait I'm writing the you can put it somewhere where you can readily take it out this is your emergency fund two you have to make sure you you and your family have enough health health cover life cover so you're covered and you're safe you and your family not just you done third you actually have to have a sip or some form of long-term investment not sip long-term investment in Blue Chip stocks um with with a horizon of 10 years 7 years plus Blue Chip stocks is if you have some money left because I know you go out drink do all these crazy things I don't think you have money left but also don't take cred card debt man if you have some money left then you can start learning about how trading works and you can learn how so now you will trade with no with no no fear now how much Capital should you actually have a good way to look at this is how much risk can you actually take can you lose 550,000 rupees in a month how much money are you okay losing I think that's a better question is that even a question that is the right question the process of trading is to remove all fear and this is the biggest fear we think of how much money you can make we don't think of how much money you can lose how much are you okay losing are you okay losing one rupe H one rupe is fine but that is not are you okay losing 1 l r depends so let's can you lose all your 50,000 Rupees no so we know the answer is between 1 and 50,000 that's a good place to start are you okay with losing 5,000 rupees if I follow the steps which was yeah I think 5,000 yeah 5,000 you're okay with now what we need to think is once you followed all these steps so there is some basic risk management in trading where you don't lose don't lose more than 1% per trade 1% of the amount that I have of your capital capital now this learning this technique is beyond the scope of this video and we'll cover that in a second video if you want us to please tell us in the comments below but if you don't want to lose more than 1% you will basically find a strategy find out the maximum loss in that strategy make sure that that is equal to 5,000 rupes and that will be your trading Capital most likely your trading capital is going to be really small and that's okay once you see profits over 1 2 3 years then you can think of increasing it so in summary I want you to think about trading Capital not as how much money you need to start to make money but how much money you're okay with losing and then backt trap what the capital should be did you enjoy yourself did you learn something yes sir I'll just go through the steps one by one and I think next time I'll not do next time we'll Place Another trade and understand the psychology so you guys can understand trading psychology without losing money

    "transcript_full": "today we're going to learn a trading strategy that will make so much money we can buy a dream vacation for us I quit trading sir what we didn't even start what happened no sir I don't want to continue total loss sir one of my friend gave me the strategy 52 week high strategy okay you know you have to buy the stock when it is moving up okay go with the flow and I I did everything back test I created all the back test support saw it completely go gone through it it says 50% of your trades are profitable 50% win win ratio okay fine ratio okay fine in the last 10 days all of my trades were in loss how many trades 10 trades sir all of them were loss red red are you feeling good of course not sir I lost my money abishek this is not how trading works all of us learn these strategies and then we'll face a series of losses and there's a way to deal with consecutive losses let's find find out [Music] how sir you said we will fix it we will fix the system we'll make sure to I'll understand what these losses are etc etc etc please fix it okay so it's not that simple first let's understand what strategy are you trading what is the strategy so it's a 52 week high strategy okay what is it you buy the stocks which is going upwards you Trail the stop loss okay so it's like a momentum strategy now the strategy itself doesn't matter you could be trading any strategy today we're going to talk about the consecutive losses this guy is facing so you're buying this is a momentum strategy stocks are going up you're buying the stocks and you're trailing the stop loss okay and you're hoping that the momentum continues and that's how you make money and how do you know it makes money so basically what I did here I did all the back testing right I'll just show you the report here this is the most important part okay wait a back test is a simple way to look at an idea put it inside a computer the computer tests it over the last 10 years and tells you whether it is profitable or not continue what's this is that the return so it's the annual return which is roughly around 30% that's crazy okay I'll make and what is this your total 1 lak has become cores of rupees well the report says too much cores too much crores also don't believe back test reports anyway keep going what's the I I'll take you to the most important part okay now you see this this percentage Yeah it says 52% yes is the winning percentage this is the source of all your sorrow exactly it's 52% winners and the rest 48% are losers which means out of 100 trates 52 will be profitable correct and out of 10 trades five will be profitable should be but you took 10 trades and loss all of them so this is not how win loss works okay so um let's imagine we have some uh profitable trades and some loss so this is your 52% right and this is your 48% correct 48% okay so these are uh profitable trades loss trades now you're saying market right report says yes yeah but that's not how life works this is how life works so this is trading sir pick a pick a chip pick another chip uh you see you see what happened here um the sequence of the profit and loss is not probability this is probability over a large number of Trades so you just picked randomly two green chips which is profitable and is does this mean there is a 100% probability trade 100% winners no right no you could pick another green and another green and another green and the probability can still be 52% now in your case if this had happened he would not be sitting here it was all red so it works on probability it's not accurately correct which is 100 me say 52 will give you a profit maybe no so you can't control the sequence of how it happens it can still be it's 50% on a very large number of trades on 10 trades you could get 10 profitable and on 10 trades you could get 10 loss correct oh God that's how probability Works in life in the world not just trading to what did you understand from this on your strategy so I got the idea which says probability you never know you know what what would be the next trade maybe but whatever trade I took all losses now how will I get this confidence to continue trading yeah I think that's the real question and the problem here isn't the strategy whatever you're doing or abishek is doing the problem is your expectation so I think there are four things you can do okay one how do you feel about making three trades profit in a row rich rich of course and when you lost 10 trades in a low how did that make you feel were you scared or were you sad I think I was scared more M because uh I don't know how long will this go the streak correct right and will my Capital survive in the longer run so two things happened here it went beyond your expectation you didn't expect it and second there is an unknown what if the so now the question is what if you get five more losing trades will you be very scared he will so you should reduce your trading size usually people look at these green chips and decide how much to actually bet and it's a bet when you're trading a system or a strategy but you should actually look at these chips how much will I lose in every single trade and if I have 10 trade in a row how will I feel so if you lost one rupe on every of these trades would it matter no no no 100 rupes oh so what you're saying here is I should be comfortable I mean at what number should I be comfortable losing from a capital is what is that what you mean absolutely oh do you have any uncle or someone who's run a business yes I think so you do what if that Uncle started a business okay he doesn't own the home anymore he's given it to the bank he's taken a loan against it took his wife's jewelry gave it to finance company took money against it took his car refinanced it sold it got some money out and put it into this one business and let's say he was expecting two three orders to come and those orders don't come will he be scared at night two questions what is that business it's his strategy well if he's spending the night in his house which is not his house he will be scared correct so any business just like trading cannot be ruled by you being super fearful now let's suppose if this same uncle had 10 businesses and he started one more and there was basically zero risk in it oh yes so he would be fine he' be okay and he'd probably run that business a lot better because he can think clearly think logically understand what's good what's bad um you're doing the same thing it's about the way we think I got it so what do you mean here is I should be okay with losses correct the the trades okay and this is different for everyone you have to decide what that number is you should be okay with it that depends on my Capital how much I I am willing to lose last time you lost 50,000 on the option vaa video we did please watch that video link is in the description it was very good episode but similarly you have to decide how much how much are you okay losing okay so that'll make you comfortable so that's Point number one okay then we have Point number two which is looking at your worst case scenario draw down that's right what is your draw down in this strategy I'll show you it's 58.9% that's a horrible draw down a draw down should be more than 20 25% but okay are you okay losing 60% of your Capital no sir what are you talking about why are you trading this because I didn't see it here's are you okay with 50% more of 60% no sir 50 exactly correct so I think what you need to think about is what's your draw down and your draw down should be really really low and then assume it's 50% more this again will make you feel better because you are now removing fear and if you don't know what a draw down is abishek will explain it to you this time Maxim uh I'll do it and scroll up and open uh charts yeah okay what is this Equity curve what is equity curve price no it's your account value so the account value goes up that means you're making a profit then account value goes down stoploss hit losing money so draw down go up good job abishek say it in the comments good job abish comments everyone please enage him he's so he's great so you see this peak over here and the market went up that's the highest point your account went up so let's say your account went from 1 lakh Rupees to 2 lakh rupees okay now that 2 lakh rupees went down to 1.5 lakh rupees that fall from 2 lakh to 1.5 lakh is your draw down okay and then it went back up again so that's your worst case scenario so what any strategy has is maximum draw Downs over the last 10 years so you have an expectation of the worst case scenario this is the price that the trade might come down to so you could have uh loss one loss two loss three loss four one profit and then 10 more losses so overall you're losing money on your entire account that is your worst case scenario got it it could be a combination of profits and losses but overall you're losing money probility and then at some point you start getting more profits and the and your account moves up but that worst case scenario that drop is called your draw down now to put this into perspective all the great investors not Traders U from Ram agrawal to war Buffett to anyone you you pick has seen at least a 50% fall and famously I remember one of them saying I'm able to weather a 60% fall which is why I'm sitting on thousands of crores today that's amazing same for trading but trading becomes comes a little harder because you're actively entering and exiting on top of that you also have trading costs adding to it right because that's also subtracting from your account so it becomes a little tougher when you're doing it in trading but uh you have to expect a huge drop to come at some point and it's part of the game okay perfect uh sir I got the idea draw down now I'll just go and no wait wait I D sit there is point number three also and the problem is your mind and your mind you can't look at the screen all day you lose your mind you have to distract yourself with something if you have a way to enter and exit the market you have a system you have a strategy of something distract yourself with something you can stay away from the screen can you maybe get a job can you start a small business can you do something to stay away from the market so my point is this do this over the weekends and follow your strategy over the week and and here is a summary of what we've learned when you see consecutive losses here's how to solve it perfect sir I understood the three steps distraction you said party but the the the trades I took in the past 10 days okay going to refund no no I won't refund all your trades bro that's in the other episode not this episode party party I'll I'll pay for the party let's go like subscribe because we think trading psychology is not talked about for people and we thought we'll create this series so if you think this was interesting please give a like subscribe say something in the comments should we continue talking about trading psychology does it help you see you in the next episode abijit abishek abishek a",

    "transcript_full": "abhishek abhishek what's up what happened sir please don't sir i am selling all the shares of my portfolio not a damn zero why are you selling all your shares sir the markets are super risky you know what happened with my friend uh-huh he lost all of his investments last week i am not going to do that with my money sorry so you wanna avoid risk if we avoided risk we would not have built this company we would not have made that stock market portfolio and we would have got no gains sir you are a businessman a founder you have money i have no money dude risk is risk it doesn't matter whether you're elon musk or you are abhishek everyone takes some sort of risk you heard the story about this guy who said i will not take any risk and he shut himself in his house didn't go to work didn't go outside because it was too risky and he stayed at home and one day a picture fell and he died what point is every decision you take invites some degree of risk so if that's the case taking no risk is also some risk so you i think one way to think about it is this you have to take a calculated risk but no one defined calculated risk for you right what is a calculated risk so to answer this let's begin the episode what are calculated risk and how you can do it in life and the stock market okay so let's start with hedge funds these guys manage billions and billions of dollars and deploy it in the stock market in companies etcetera and they have to give a return to their investors correct so now you might have a sip of a few thousand rupees true 10,000 rupees not lakhs of rupees yeah but these guys actually invest crores of rupees and tens of thousands of crores what do they spend most of their time on strategy okay execution okay they want to work fast now probably on that front actually they spend all of their time and effort on risk management if they understand what are the worst case scenarios that can happen then they try to mitigate it stop loss execution risk of how quickly we can execute an order how do you make sure that when they place an order the market doesn't move they slice the order etcetera etcetera it's really complex sir how will this information benefit me tell me let me let me let me explain please everyone cares about risk but the people obsessed about money care about it more and people like you who are actually fearful about money have not quantified the risks about it if the market crashes today what's your reaction gonna be this is exactly what should not happen i know exactly how many times nifty has fallen i know what are the worst case scenarios and i'm prepared for a 50% fall on my portfolio i'm okay with it oh you know the future i don't know the future i know it's possible that a 50% fall can happen and i should be alright which is why all my money is not in equity there is some in debt basically i have some calculation some expectation behind if this happens then i'll do that but yes i don't know the future the problem is you're taking blind risk and when i take risk i try to add some logic to it so perhaps it's calculated risk help me understand let's suppose you're in an aircraft and something happens and the aircraft is going to crash and you have two options option one you get a parachute and option number two you just say bye don't have time for this i'll jump out because i'm scared and and maybe a tree will save me what's a better way to do this burns everything sir obviously one now option one i'll take the parachute i'll jump correct so when you jump without a parachute that is blind risk which is what you're perhaps doing here and when you try to jump with with a parachute you're taking some calculated risk now in either case you could crash and burn but at least the chances of surviving is a little better when you have a parachute and a plan to deploy it so i just took a calculated risk so in the context of the stock market jumping with the parachute probably looks like buying the index fund or buying 30 stocks that you've researched equally divided all large cap thought about the next 10 etcetera and jumping without a parachute looks like wow factory logo this is so beautiful i'll put all my money in this one company no i don't do that jumping without a parachute okay you get the point yeah and this is why you see headlines like this nine out of ten traders lose in the market because they didn't take calculated risk yeah and they don't have a strategy they don't understand how it works okay so fair point i got it i just have one question how am i supposed to calculate my risk that's simple wait wait wait i have a better option what if i copy your risk idea the way you have calculated this you'll copy all my trades correct in the same proportion copy copy copy to the point to the point full stop this is a horrible idea so everyone's risk tolerance is actually different and you know what you're trying to do over here you're trying to mask your fear by just saying if something happens you'll come to me and say it happened with you also and you're trying to find a way to not be scared by putting it all on me dude the point is that you become independent sorry you become independent and you don't need me but you can't copy anyone because my car emi versus your car emi has a huge difference i agree you've not got married yet so that expense is yet to happen so our lives financially and events that are going to happen are different so our risk profiles are different wait you know we've seen abhishek taking random trades in the office and that's definitely not calculated risk so we try to create abhishek's risk profile and help him out let's say he earns 1 lakh rupees a month if you've seen our previous videos you would know that he's into a lot of stuff so after all his expenses he's left with 30,000 rupees since he's already struggling with his emergency fund investing all this money might just be an example of a blind risk so let's just move some of this money to his emergency fund first now with the rest of the money he can try out investing i think everyone in the office would agree that abhishek is definitely not ready for trading risk risk because his investments are not in place he doesn't have the prior knowledge or experience of the markets so let's just move to safe investment options since he's not a pro at analyzing companies yet he can go for an index fund on mutual funds now abhishek is a fairly young guy with no dependents and less responsibilities so he can go for more risk and definitely more equity exposure in his portfolio if you want to know the portfolio split for your risk personality you should check out the cheat sheet so i think there are two types of risk let's suppose there is career risk your where you get your salary from and second is your investment risk you know both of them have one thing in common you have to spend ten years building that craft to actually get a great salary because you are very good at a particular skill i think a lot of people right now switch jobs which is fine but switching careers is actually in most cases not good because you want to be really good at one thing and anything less than a decade is not likely to give you the best results the same thing is true for investing too so i have to spend like five ten years learning what investing is will help me understand what is a and you learn by doing right so you learn about you know about an index fund start your first 1,000 rupees or 500 rupees or whatever okay and by doing that you'll start learning it read more watch more videos read books do whatever you can like you do in your job to understand what investing is and over a ten year period you will get returns but don't you think that the time that i'm spending to get that calculated risk is too long but that's how life is when you're young you think ten years is a long time but then as you get older time goes by really fast so if time is gonna go by really fast why not just spend it in a nice way and a correct way so for example investing here's what's missing one you don't have a personal finance plan which means your emergency fund health life insurance yeah yeah yeah is not set second you do not know what your risk profile is how much equity how much debt how much what third you don't have your goal set once you have your goal set you can split it according to that fourth you don't have an investing strategy in place do you put most in large caps do you put mid caps what's your strategy if you don't wanna do that and you don't have time then you put it into in an index fund so the summary is skill and money both compound and compounding needs a superpower which is what is what time it's not me it's not only your direction it's over a long period of time okay sir i get it but what about this generation you know we get bored from ten seconds to instagram reels and you are telling me to wait for ten years i don't think everyone will get that no actually you're right but you know all gains come from asymmetric returns let me explain so i don't think most of us will be able to hold on to investments for ten years correct i don't think most of us will be able to stick to a skill work on it every single weekend every single week for ten years but the ones who do will become the outliers and i think if you're watching this and you're sitting with me you want something out of life so perhaps some people will which is obsessing over risk and doing your thing for ten plus years and taking concentrated bets on yourself spending time with this and probably some form of equity whether esops in a company or equity in the stock market but you have to do it over a long period of time got it the biggest problem in this is compounding works like this nothing happening for a long time then suddenly something happens and then nothing happens for a long time then suddenly something happens but it's increasing it's increasing but only when you look back three to five years when we look at the stock market we say 12% cagr you know what this means uh-huh this means year one maybe 0% year two maybe plus 5% year three could be plus 20% year three could be minus 5% now i don't know what that adds up to but in five years it'll average 12% and we are so used to consistently getting something right i understood risk now what about the returns what will i get let's think about it from a investing point of view so investing what you can do is you can reduce risk and increase the chances of a better reward so let's start with a portfolio okay in a portfolio of say 20 companies it's possible ten percent of these companies don't survive in many cases there are very large companies which went completely bankrupt so there was this company called enron in the us which was really really popular everyone traded it and they were revolutionizing energy at that point enron went to zero so is that something you can predict absolutely not because in this case the numbers were fudged by this company so they it was a financial fraud and there's no way you can do this so the best way is when you have a diversified portfolio assume certain number of companies can go to zero and once you've told yourself this you will be a little less surprised because i have calculated my risk not calculated you actually set your expectations oh and that changes everything jalimonger said a happy life the key is low expectations the second expectation should be you know that nifty has fallen 50% or more in the past in a single run especially the two thousand eight crisis so it might fall again it will happen we don't know when and our job is not to predict because then fear will overtake us but we know this will happen at some point so abhishek now you gotta go back home and you too and write in the comments what all you're doing for the next ten years okay on the skill side on the money side and i think if you write this down you'll be more committed and if you come back ten years from now you'll say wow video and this is what i learned nice nice also don't forget to subscribe and follow and subscribe exactly as a what if i got to your list calculations bts so bts is he on",

    "transcript_full": "[Music] why don't we make this a little simpler instead of you giving money to the bank let's remove the bank very nice and the bank giving money to businesses let's remove the businesses and simplify this a little bit it and replace this with this guy look at him perfect I think he needs a loan to get a new phone a personal loan and he has the money so perhaps this money can be given straight to him he can give an 18% return to him and for the service I'll take 2% so why don't you guys perfect so I am a P2P lending platform very simply put people who have money lend it to people who need the money for an interest rate of course up to 20% he gets his loan he gets a great return and I get a really nice juicy cut now over here I have one more feature to tell you are you ready apart from the great returns if you give a loan you also will get daily returns which means you don't have to wait for a long time you'll get a credit every single day and of course all of this can be done through the app so download it finish your kyc and start investing right now what are you waiting for download it and begin oh my God not again there was something definitely wrong with that pitch and I also noticed all these comments over here saying it to be lending B so in this episode of De influencing we thought why not we pick the topic of P2P lending we'll talk talk about the good we'll talk about the bad cuz certainly these guys won't so let's start with step number one what the hell is P2P [Music] lending so first I'd like to say there's nothing wrong with the p2b business model in fact like most Financial products they all have have their own risk curves and reward curves the problem comes when you perceive the reward to be too high and the risk to be too low the truth is everything has risk so in this episode we'll talk about the risks of P2P so you understand how it is especially since it's such a new product but before we go there let's start by understanding how a bank works I'll oversimplify the banking business model but let's quickly go through it we have a bank which takes in depositors from People Like Us who put put in their savings account so the more Savers they have the larger the deposit the bank also needs to put this money to good use so they give this out to other businesses now this could be small businesses could be people could be sold Proprietors and the difference over here is what the bank keeps now what a P2P lender does is he wants to sort of remove the bank from the picture remove the businesses from the picture and say why don't the transactions happen between people you have Pier One and you have Pier 2 this guy needs a loan this guy has some money [Music] simply simply match these two people give the loan and perer two gives it back with a piece of Interest this guy's happy because he made some extra money with that interest everything's working isn't this nice directly person to person but of course there's one thing how do you find such people who keeps track of this who does the kyc how do you do this actually cuz you can't do this on an Excel sheet enter the P2P platform its job is very simple and I'll show it with a phone the platform digitally matches such people maintains the records and does everything to enable such a transaction interesting right now in India P2P is fairly new but it's been around for a while in China in fact in 2012 P2P started and boy did it boom there were so many people offering 10 12% returns which was massive when compared to Banks who were giving much less and this was 4X or 5x of what you could get at a savings account and as you can imagine the number of P2P platforms swell to 3,000 and there were billions of dollars being transacted through such platforms but like all things it seemed very shiny and nice and beautiful on the outside but inside soon ugliness was revealed and China found out that over 40% of these platforms were actually not real the transactions weren't happening correctly and they were funzy schemes so the government entered shut down one of the biggest P2P lenders of the time that was almost a $7 billion fraud so naturally the public in China lost trust in such platforms and as you can imagine few years later the number dropped and in 2019 P2P lending was banned but see this problem is not there in India India has regulations in fact the RBI calls them P2P licenses and this started way back in 2017 and we have about 25 registered P2P lenders you can actually find the list in the description from the RBI so the problem isn't with the business it's how it's marketed as recently as 2023 December the RBI stopped a bunch of malpractices on how these products were marketed the first biggest risk is low credibility of the borrower I mean a loan book is only good as the credit worthiness of who it's given the loan to think about the borrower this person probably didn't get a loan through its traditional methods like a credit card or through a bank and he has no option left but to come to such a platform to get this money there also could be some desperation for this person I mean why is he agreeing to pay such a high interest rate on the loan does he have Financial pressure and we know the people who have Financial pressure are the most desperate there is no collateral and the chances of this borrower defaulting is relatively much higher the second risk is the NPA risk or the non-performing Asset Risk now we all know the economy goes through boom and bus Cycles when everyone's being paid salaries on time when things are going well the system will autod deduct the money and hopefully the loan will be repaid and you should be okay as an investor but what happens in a time of Crisis let's look at Co or any other time like 2008 at that time will this individual borrower actually be able to pay since there's no security the chances of this NPA Rising is very high for example During the covid period micro finance companies had a very high double digigit NPA because they were unable to do business they were individuals they came from backgrounds where it was impossible to repay and for that period the risk became really really high as an individual can you actually handle such a high risk in fact one of the largest P2P lenders in Europe called mtos has an NP of about 9 or 10% normally and during covid this went all the way to 22% did you know there's such a large risk in something like a P2P platform again there's nothing wrong with the business model just people don't know that this exists if you did or you didn't put it in the comments I'd love to know what you think about it so how does an NPA affect a person let's suppose a person invests 1 lakh rupes in in a P2P platform and this 1 lakh rupes gets automatically divided to a 100 different loans now let's suppose out of these different loans 100 people five people don't pay back anything that 5,000 rupees 5 multiplied by 1,000 is gone to zero so now whatever returns you'll get you'll get on the 95,000 rupees because the other became absolutely zero this is why NPA as a measure is really important another thing we noticed on the Internet is that people compare Bank FS with P2P Investments I can maybe guess why this happens they both sound like they're fixed they both have some tenure they both have this feeling you're giving some money as a loan and getting some return back very similar sounding to bank but bank fds and P2P Investments are completely different they're not the same I mean these guys over here are unsecured this is not backed by anything and the returns aren't fixed it can vary you could get NP P some people may not pay back Etc so we don't know actually what the returns are until you actually get them and in the case of Bank fds there is an insurance of up to 5 lakh rupees by the RBI so there is a difference these two can't be compared and finally we have a little flaw in the business model of the P2P lender too and it's called liquidity risk very simply put we have a lender who has given money and we have a borrower who's taken the money now in some cases is the P2P platform is giving a daily payout to the lender now this sounds great as marketing but imagine this if the lender is getting a daily payout but the borrower is not paying daily then this is a mismatch what happens when the withdrawals increase but the input actually decreases where will that extra money come out from so the next time you see an advertisement that says up to 36% returns you know the risks involved especially you guys I'm talking to you who get that message every first with a salary credited and want to make that quick buck and think 30% 20% is ginormous and you should use this opportunity to make money please think assess the risks breathe a little bit and understand the possibility first make sure you understand every asset class has risk including this one and it should be part of a portfolio it can't be a major part because the risk in this is obviously higher second understand that this is a new kind of investment product we're all still figuring this out The Regulators the investors the platforms and as time goes by this will become a little more clearer a little better but you have to do your job in understanding risk and third

    "title_current": "Will AI replace your job?",
    "transcript_full": "a few days ago a teammate asked sir do you think our jobs are safe and I started wondering about the future of work I mean if the writers are using chat GPT the designers are using mid Journey the coders already have ai inside their ID or even something like Devon then do you even need them in the future [Music] so there are three kinds of jobs you have physical manual labor kinds of jobs you have intelligent-based kinds of jobs and finally you have managerial kinds of jobs and ever since the Advent of Technology we've always thought that Tech Will basically replace physical manual labor like this 1983 New York Times article States the factory of the future may be literally dehumanized and if plants become computerized a large number of workers will be laid off I mean creativity cognition and critical thinking it's human right no other animal can do it and definitely not a computer right but I proved it wrong repetitive and blue collar jobs I understand are replaced but if you look at say a barber or an electrician or a Carpenter you can't replace this because it requires some Artistry a computer can't do that right so these jobs which are human are here to stay but today's white color jobs are actually at risk from being replaced from AI for example AI excels in two major areas problem solving and repetitive cognitive tasks it can analyze massive data detect patterns and solve problems more ACC accurately than humans and repetitive tasks like document review and portfolio management can be done way faster by AI so basically the things AI is actually good at it'll actually replace those jobs and it sounds a little counterintuitive but my job as a CEO of this company is actually at risk because essentially I have to do hard problem solving decide something for a team and lay out Frameworks for everyone to follow to achieve a goal something that AI can can do pretty well so my job is at risk as well correct for example a Chinese company last year appointed an AI bot as its CEO this one is probably done as a marketing gimmick but if you extrapolate where AI has gone and where it is today can it really create plans for teams find which teammate is weak which is not who to hire who to not Based on data and what the industry is doing I think the answer is a scy yes does it mean you should stop doing your current job and go for a blue collar job instead well yes and no the answer is actually hidden in the 1800s it's the early 1800s in England a time when weaving looms were the bread and butter of a group of textile workers the luddites these guys were skilled craftsmen who depended on handlooms for their livelihood but then came the Industrial Revolution factories sprang up steam engin started running and suddenly the automated looms could manufacture months worth of textiles in just a few days for the luddites this was a threat to their livelihood their art in their frustration they rebelled destroy the machines and halt the Looms yet their fate was sealed the machines obviously stayed and their jobs gone while luddites lost their specific role the Industrial Revolution created new opportunities in other areas ludik found work in operating in these new machines While others shifted to supporting Industries like Transportation coal mining steel production driven by Factory growth and this is called the Luddite fallacy and the Luddite fallacy has happened throughout history multiple times again and again like in the 1980s there was the Advent of the spreadsheet in the new computers which means accountants and people who are typ in lost their jobs but the same people found a bunch of new jobs we also have ATM tellers before an ATM we used to have a physical person sitting on a chair asking you how much money you want and giving you actual cash these were tellers the automated teller machine took away that job but because of this new tech upgrade the number of branches that we could have across the country increased and therefore the number of jobs within banking actually increased but companies are firing so many employees every day they're replacing humans with AI even companies like Google and Facebook have replaced people with AI so how can you be sure that your job won't go away I think I know [Music] how so 40% of global jobs right now are exposed to the risk of AI the risk of the actual change but on the other hand if you look at India about 26% of all our jobs are at risk now why is this look at a veloped economy with less population and a underdeveloped economy or a developing economy with a lot of population usually these people spend a lot of time on automation because they don't have enough labor but countries like India Vietnam China have a lot of people so their societies are designed to use labor effectively which means they don't want to replace people because they have an abundance of people in fact we found this interesting research from Microsoft research 45% % of employees globally believe that AI can replace them in the future yeah okay but this is what employers have to say most employers worry that there's not enough talent to fill all these job roles so the problem is not jobs the problem is skill in fact Mark Zuckerberg himself was writing emails to AI researchers trying to hire them and this trend is continuing we found this interesting job over here for a Content writer on LinkedIn and it's specifically States please do not use AI as if it's an evil thing if you ever see something like this run away because AI is here to stay if you ignore and don't use it you my friend could be a lite and an interesting story is this an entire company fired 60 people and just had one person you know why all of the work was now done by an AI for the writing and to validate the writing there was this one person but here's what I'm more most excited about for every single industry this is true but let's take a case of a lawyer the lawyer's job is much more nuanced there is storytelling there is EQ he's actually performing in front of the court and he's maintaining relations with his client something that an AI definitely can't do so the AI will complement the lawyer not replace it this is why a paralal job will actually cease to exist but a lawyer's job will not cuz it's a lot more than nuance so jobs which require a lot of trust are actually here to stay at least for now so storytelling like my job over here cannot be replaced and I have something crazy to show you let me show you something interesting

    "title_current": "Why GenZ Struggles to Save Money",
    "transcript_full": "Take a shot if you feel poor even though you earn more than your parents when they were your age. D 01 has all these Gen Z employees and they all think they're really good at managing money, but I don't think so. So, we got them all here and I have all these questions to figure out, are they really poor? So, let's start with question number two. Take a shot if you went out with your friends during the month end even though you know you don't have any money. [Music] Never tell me the story. You act like oh my UK is not working. Majority of my friends are still in college. So now because I am earning so it's like okay next question and you guys should also answer all the questions and put it in the comments and it'll be a fun exercise for you. Drink a shot if you bought your phone in cash and it costs more than 50% of your salary. [Music] What phone is it? iPhone 15. Does the opposite sex notice that you have like an iPhone? When a thought like this comes where you look at someone else and he has an iPhone and that's the reason you're buying an iPhone for validation, just label that thought, I'm buying it because I ought to be popular. Don't tell yourself n I'm going to use it for social media. Just be honest to yourself so that the next time you feel envy, you don't react to it. Okay? Take a shot. If you've hidden or sneaked a shopping box from your parents or flat mates because you ordered a lot of stuff that month and you were a little embarrassed. Very nice. It was cute. I know. Tell me the story. Then my dresses, then I used to call delivery partner. Okay guys, let's play a game. How many things did you buy in the last 30 days? Open your bank account and count. 23 2 10 34 Wo. Okay. Now, be honest. When you went through this, do you think you spent more than what you thought? This is more than I thought. This is called denial when you want to go and buy stuff and the internet and the these apps are actually designed to make you order again. The only thing you can really do is you can't stop using them. You have to use them. But if you label the thought or maybe write down all your expenses, you can at least control it. Okay, this question is a little crazy. Are you ready? How many of you want to buy a house in the future? Drink a shot if you've not started saving up for it. Oh wow. So, first we'll go, why do you want to buy [Music] house? I think I'm too young to think about buying a house. If you buy a house for 1 after 20 years interest, how much will you pay? I think 1 cr 50 actually. 0 cr actually. Imagine you have bought a house for 1 cr. It's on loan. You paid EMI for 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, 1 year, 5 years. And you've paid roughly 52 lakhs out of that 1 cr. How much is left? 50 lakhs. 88 lakhs. You have to pay 88 lakhs more and on top of that you'll pay more interest. So a better way to think about this, you buy a piece of land or a house in a smaller town in the outskirts. So that's one, but then who will stay there? You stay in a city. Second is you divide your life into two parts. When you have high energy, when you have low energy, you actually need the home when you cannot go anywhere else apart from the home. When will you have low energy? I'm guessing after 60, I guess. Can you plan for it then? And maybe use that money right now for your high energy years on travel and experiences and optimizing for experiences. So that's the end of round number one. Now we move to round number two where all of their shots have already been changed. Let's begin. Question one. Sir, sir, sir. No. Hey security, it's not fair. You should pay a fine. No. [Music] Okay. Round number two. Question one. Take a shot if you have splurged because you were having a bad day. Really? Ah. Yeah. You shot because you're having a bad day. I shopped. Yeah. What did you buy? Food. Things that I don't exactly need, I save them in my cart. Then that one day comes when I'm like next question. Take a shot if you'd be willing to take a pay cut if you get a chance to work only 4 days a week. Where are the Jenz's? You sound like millennials. Who would take that deal? You come one day extra and get paid extra for that one day. Actually, I heard a lot of Jenzi cares about anti-hustle, mental health, etc. which millennials actually I'm sorry for this generation. What do you think about 5day work week or a 4 day work week? I think there are two kinds of work. One is which resets every day. So you come to work, you create content, the content is out, next day it's zero and you start again. The other kind of work is whatever you did last week, you have to do less the next week. For example, if you are say a founder, you had to hire so many people, take interviews every day, but team I don't have to take more interviews in the future. the HR will do it, other people will do it. So if you're in the second kind of workplace, you can work 2 days a week, but the problem is to get to that point, you have to work really, really hard. So you rather optimize to work more when you're younger so that later on in life, you are paid to work less and paid more for your judgment. Next question. Take a shot if you bought something just because an influencer was using it or promoting it, please. I bought like a wax thing. I was like it will save time also. Eventually I got convinced and then it smelled like Next question. Once you get an appraisal, where will you splurge the extra money? [Music] Probably nothing. This is really interesting when you're saying I want to buy a home and I live in a rented home and you're saying right now your situation is bad and in the future when I climb this ardous mountain after 25 years I will reach the peak which is buying a home then I'll be happy. You're saying I accept I'll be unhappy every single day of my life. You've already achieved a lot in your lives. You just don't think it's a lot because there's someone else who has more than you. Guys, does social media pressure you into get education, marry, get a car? Drink the shot. Drink the shot. Instagram. [Music] Substory I think. Okay, next question. Drink a shot if you have more than three subscriptions. More than three. How many do you have? One. One. One. Swiggy, Zomato, Netflix, Hot Star, Z5, YouTube, Spotify, Apple Cloud, Google Drive. So my uh Spotify subscription went on for like six to 7 months and I didn't know and then one day I saw key 179 and then I saw similar thing happened with me also. This is round three and these are the worst drinks. Would you quit your job if you think that it's affecting you mentally? I would just like to say whoever made the shots. I think a millennial would have answered they will continue to work there forever until they find a job the money slightly better but honestly they probably wouldn't look. What do you guys think about that? What's the definition of a toxic workplace? [Laughter] They used to hold the [Music] emergency I would say toxic yes but this is also exploitation actually the advantage you guys have is you have choice which is why you can switch so it's a good thing before us there was no choice they were not many companies there was not much talent so everyone assumed they'll just stay in the same company for a longer time but I think when you switch because you feel that place is better that's a problem if you're switching only because you're optimizing for money you might find it but you might might be miserable so you should be okay with that next question take a shot if you think you understand less about money than your parents did at your age I know full of and I think this is this generation superpower out. Everyone says Jenzi this jzi that. But it's actually the most informed, former driven, anxietydriven, self-aware generation we actually know. They know what makes them happy. They would prefer mental solitude, mental peace versus just money. They actually for the first time have some kind of balance. So give a round of applause for yourself. [Applause]",

smarties why is this chilli sauce dalio that's disgusting tea doctor hree and for the first time we have this no no thousand rupees every year to keep this gold in the locker now let's suppose there's a flood after the flood you find out that your gold is gone you will have to bear all the losses not the bank mid for fact mid for fact mid for fact bank for what's your vote i don't know actually it's fact it's your loss if an act of god happens tornado earthquake flood your stuff was in the locker it's your responsibility it's gone in case of bank's negligence then the bank is liable drink your shots bliss drink oh this is good you there watching this i want you to answer all of these questions see if you get the answers right or wrong and if you beat these guys or not next question you're driving through gurgaon during a flood and your engine gets water damaged oh shit but you have a comprehensive car insurance so your insurer will pay only 50% of your repair cost myth or fact what do you think fact fact i told you it's an easy answer but you all are wrong it's actually a myth so myth yeah so a standard comprehensive insurance policy does not cover water damage inside you so you pay 100% of that cost have your shots please i have to drink yeah i was drinking water next question you have a health insurance policy and you get injured due to a war you are a normal civilian walking on the road if you go to the hospital you will not get the claim i would like to believe samit fact see i i don't think there is words i don't think i am a myth but i don't like to believe you the answer is fact obviously correct let's go no shot for us let's take example of parashar parashar has 50 lakh rupees in his gmat account and you have a best friend what's his name mudit mudit so you have kept mudit as your nominee you also have a son he's not the nominee now let's say you pass away oh my god all your stocks will be transferred to mukesh because he's the nominee not your son myth or fact but we get the point myth or fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact fact i love this because this is a myth nominee is a custodian or trustee once the legalities ensue the person who's the actual legal heir will eventually come to so in this case yes it would have gone to mudit but because we know the legal heir is your son it would be transferred to your son have your shot what's going these are the scores at the end of round one let's go however we have one winner so far which is tanya yay oh you guys won't be so happy yeah yes because she gets a special power bring it in a special power thank you is magic drink oh my god she can choose anyone over here that she wishes and you will have to eat it drink it i don't know what you do with it okay can i get a compliment for me real quick bye next question round number two yes for round two we'll change the drinks and these are much worse now you are on a vacation to paris yay woah wow and you order a croissant prashant prashant prashant prashant prashant you are offered to pay and you insert your card in the machine and you get an option inr or euro which one will you pick a is inr b is euro i'm interested euro euro euro euro yes dinesh inr the answer is you have to choose b oh i remember a story i've also traveled abroad but i didn't know that i was transaction alright shots fewer cheers sir hey i can see it am i ready yes yes sir come on if you guys don't answer this properly right what do you mean you're fired there is a very famous widely accepted way of personal finance you will find anywhere on the internet mhmm it's called the fifty thirty twenty rule should everyone follow it to save money a is yes no b is no no can i do round applause for them this is the right answer finally we are getting something right i think people who are just starting out cannot invest when they start off and this is perfectly fine swati and i didn't start long term investing until we crossed the age of 30 if i actually when you said that you started at 30 it was a sense of relief for me that that's why i said it so you're at least getting started so it's alright if you don't start what is the hurry do you feel it's late do you what what do you what are your thoughts on this i know my personality i'm like this only i like to travel i like to spend on myself i like to spend on people i'm with my partner is much more rakhi does it yeah yeah so then it's fine right yeah it's fine then you have started it balanced it out next question fall out i will choose the person who gets this so here's my theory i do not want to give it to a person who's been answering correctly because it might just backfire or not which is why i'm sorry makes sense makes sense next question you are at your roka ceremony and your best friend gifts you 1 lakh rupees cash let's say he transfers it online now this is a completely taxed b maybe taxable depending on bunch of stuff so i'll go with taxable in my knowledge gifts are not taxable is what i know absolutely right these guys actually did a very good job gifts are not taxable on marriage date yes but this is loka yeah yes see you that's it let's go since it's loka you will maybe tax they're not your shot for you oh shit next question prashni four you're driving down and there's a dent in your car the repair cost is 5,000 rupees exactly okay but you have comprehensive insurance policy great what do you do option a file insurance claim b pay 5,000 out of your own pocket for no reason problems we are pressured you guys are all correct yes so what the insurance company does is to prevent you from taking money from the insurance what they do is they give you a no claim bonus in case you do not claim so if it's a small amount like 5,000 rupees ideally you don't claim it and pay it out of your own pocket this is end of round two and we have three winners one two three i pick one it's gonna be this guy redemption and we have a special power for you bring it in what is this revenge time what the fuck is this chili noodles these are brains oh no do you wanna use your special powers for someone yeah welcome to round number three tanya is winning this is actually a really fun round so if all of you are thinking she'll win variables everyone over there also has to participate and see if you actually beat tanya or she beat you this is a prop question you have a picture of a road accident so do you assume both of them have comprehensive insurance which vehicle will get the insurance claim you can also say both time starts now 5432 will get claim now one yes zero let's see what your answers are look for so you say white white white white white why did you mark brown actually insurance about car insurance i don't know the other party is also included you're saying this guy won't get the claim no i'm saying he will get the claim wrong side look at the road look at the traffic actually my over smart over smart yes prashant that's right can you cheer him for the show so basically if you're ever taking insurance and you have done something which is wrong even though there was an accident aap kibas comprehensive claim you are not eligible if you're driving on the wrong side you're breaking the law you will not get money next question spot all the dark patterns in the ten minute delivery app 1234 cool here is the answer come see this together okay one save 40 6 this is actually a dark pattern the saving is actually not there the second is that they pre added the membership now maybe the membership is good but they can't take away your choice as a user up to 200 give you one of the two i think we all know this you all marked it also so these were the three can we do a round of applause so far what you didn't get you'll have to have shots you have to have three go go let's go let's go pancha please so far tanya was winning but because this one had so many variables she's not winning anymore the last question will actually decide who will win and i hope you two are following this and we'll see who wins before i tell the last question of money when you were growing up so you'd hear like you can't eat out every week we can't eat out every week you eat out only once every few months this actually shapes the way you think about money when you grow up so what were your habits right now that have continued despite that you can probably afford stuff i'm very scared of obligations you have someone in family who had obligations and then that's why you're scared of it my father he he took a lot of loan and couldn't pay it back madam i would never take a loan madam just say for example even for a car i will save i will invest and then i'll get a car my parents have been like my parents was in defense so a lot lot of salary was there i have been conditioned where i don't have to spend much feel satisfied with whatever you have so i'm quite glad that those teaching from my parents on those days is still getting carried away cheers to that very dear but cheers cheers to that cheers to that cheers to that cheers to that cheers to that cheers to that cheers to that cheers to that cheers to that che cheesy it has 5 5 sir you could both are texted 3 i need 8 2 1 yeah yeah do not read your offer letter like this take care i'm really good okay so so how many did you find three only how many did you find two only three four five you found five four before i tell you the winners these are five red flags in this offer letter the ctc was 28.75 lakhs but the fixed portion was just 8.25 lakhs so that's a red flag second the notice period was one twenty days which is way too long for any non managerial employee next the variable pay is purely discretionary so the payout isn't really guaranteed then the joining marks over here and i hope you have your marks for the answers you didn't get you'll have to drink go i hope this was useful and you learned something new see you in the next

to choose the right stocks choosing stocks you know how many stocks are there grow stock value stock small return supposed to do you need a big brain to think but mut fund Equity debt Equity plus debt hybrid flexi cap tax saving fund you know what a perfect portfolio is a myth come here come here come sit sit sit sit H here's the problem okay you have so little money and you have so many options and unknowingly you have procrastinated dude you think problem I will micro Analyze This what happens to that company what happens in this situation what if I should I should check this also so your dreams of retiring early smashed your chance of making those lacks of rupees over you buying that car going abroad if you don't want to tell me say it I will go and work no no chill chill this happens to you this happens to me and people watching this video so we will talk about this new word now decision fatig what's the solution I'll tell you the [Music] solution you know adults make 35,000 decisions a day what I don't believe it dude think about it right everything from when you get up when you brush your teeth salt or pepper what are you working on right now oh the Fest so the 01 Fest you have to think about the lineup who's going stage how do people get the passes it's unlimited and apart from that you have the production of all of this video content we're trying to make new series oh my goodness website it's kind of crazy and when the brain makes all these decisions then you add a bunch more decisions on top of it and you have too many choices and then those choices actually cause your brain to go toodles I'm going to die for a little bit because this is too much and it goes I agree you know our parents had very limited choices in life like like internet cont but limited choice in career okay limited choice in what how they get to office engineer doctor correct limited choice in a lot of things and if you think about it we live in the age of abundance and there's this Paradox of choice we have way too much choice and that's actually a problem how is that a problem like have you been to a buffet and you don't know where to start or gone through that endless Netflix Loop and you don't know where to actually what to watch what to watch and then once you're watching it like maybe I could have found something else here's how age of abundance works when you have a lot of choice you think this is really important and I'll figure it out and just like your career your future your skill and everything else that's important and those abs that you'll never get AB you put it out and then time goes by because you've actually not made a decision and then you start to think I need more time because I'll take a quality decision even Investments you think okay I need a little more time let me understand what the market is but now what's happening dude is that time has gone by and you've just procrastinated but don't you think that is important because I need to spend time to learn N I totally agree but then once a year or two years have go gone by a new monster will come the former monster and this monster will say to your Market has made New Heights and then you'll try to invest and then because you want to do it in one day you'll take a bad bad decision poor decision it didn't work out so I think the first step is having too much Choice knowing actually makes poor decision- making because of this flowchart and like decision fatigue is not like physical fatigue like when you go to play cricket okay you get tired by the end of the day and then you ask for an off the next day but in decision pity you just don't take the decision you just ignore it it happens here so when you know something is important it happens here and when you're not making a decision that sort of is a decision right you've decided not to take a step towards it so decision fatigue actually exists in everything even stuff like clothes and food like when you're selecting clothes for example okay it takes a lot of time and it takes a pressure ious decision making ability at that time you could take what 30 minutes to select clothes and people have found Solutions of it right so for example people use a capsule wardrobe system oh like today I'll wear this tomorrow I'll wear that blah blah blah so they don't have to make a decision they can quickly wear what they want or they have like seven pieces of clothing and just mix and match already done by Monday I'll wear this so decision fatigue exists everywhere and they found their own Solutions we'll talk about how to do it in money okay so take your phone out okay and uh write a list of all the things you need to figure out before you actually invest life a invest okay okay let's go one eternity later done okay read it out do I have enough money left okay what it's my list where did I spend all of my money okay I should take out time every Sunday to invest all right uh where do I invest okay uh uh how much uh should I invest all right I can see your entire list let me check previous investment first then you've invest yeah not bad so what we can do is we can actually turn this into a process right so how much money you're left can be turned into a budget so you actually decide how much money you want to spend during the month so you have a process to it then you can think about the Sip if you have a goal like you told me you want to buy these things over here you written yeah new sneakers so you can have an autopay sip it pays every month automatically so as soon as you get your salary the same day or the next day the Sip amount is deducted and what you're left with is well your Kaa money because your investment money has already been invested right so all of this is actually borrowed from something called the VAR framework what is this vary framework so hold this VAR stands for values Automation rationality and intuition values means you can't you have to Value certain things over other things you have a list of things to do all of them can't be important yeah it depends on the priority no yeah like for example choosing your next watch is less important than actually making your first emergency fund and you get the point right so you have to make sure that you have prioritized what you want to do somewhere not in your head but somewhere written down automation we live in the internet age and a lot of things can be automated like mandatory sip correct like not mandatory but an sip that auto every single month correct another thing that could be automated is say the credit card payments oh yes reminder comes and it auto autop pays everything you don't have to take that decision another thing is right like about decision making if something takes only 2 or 3 minutes to do just do it immediately at the spot a lot of us think this is easy this is small and because so many two minute things piles up and you have to do something urgently you just feel drained and pressured with all of this work if something can be done now finish it completely like getting to inbox zero and reading all your WhatsApp messages the the last part of the framework is RI rationality and intuition now think about it let's imagine a person who has 100 rupes as salary and is paying 80 rupees as Emi very extreme example now in this case he has barely enough money to actually last the month right 20 so should he actually automate his credit card payments in this case no because it actually it doesn't make any rational sense that could be his emergency fund no I mean emergency fund he doesn't have enough money to last the month so the point is everyone's situation is different make sure none of these are blanket and you can't automate everything some things need to be relied on your discretion and that's what this framework means right okay sir I think you are thinking a lot on this so what you're saying is create a plan and follow it right now I think if the amount of time and effort that I'll you know put into create that plan don't you think that is much more higher so you're thinking creating those processes and yeah will actually take more time than taking the decision itself you're actually underestimating decision fatigue right so there was actually a study done with 1,100 judges and the judges had to decide whether they should give the person parole or not that means he could leave jail and leave go to his home and go to his home forre so the study was based on how these decisions are being taken so you would think it would be the severity of the crime the type of people being Etc but the biggest variable was the time of day how so imagine the judge coming into this court he's well rested fresh in the morning 65% of the decisions were that he would give parole and then as the day would go by he be tired and then he'll say there yeah and it become negative okay and then would come lunch the judge would then go take a break probably listen to some music eat something he'd be rested again and as soon as he re-entered the courtroom the decision would become 65% in favor again again and then as the day went by and the judge would get tired again it would become negative so you can see a judge who has to make a lot of decisions is being affected by having too many variables through the day coming back to back and it's affecting the percentage and this was done on a large sample size that's that's a real research that's a real research and that's their full-time job their job is Judgment so dude so probably making a process is something you need to figure out I mean think about how many steps you need to make even if you understand investing you need to think about how you'll diversify the stocks correct what industry gets how much weightage sectors should it be equal or do you want to make it weighted should you select the larger ones or go for the smaller companies which might have larger growth potential I can name a thousand other factors the decision on just creating a portfolio could be crazy so what's the summary of this I have to automate my decisions and I'll put it I have to create some processes and put it in a system right anything else yeah I mean maybe you could use this mind [Music] map and here's one more mind map did you like this video yes hit that subscribe button and say something nice in the comments if you thought you learned something see you in the next episode what r i we say okay this future don't matter I have seen it all",

    "title_current": "Is Bitcoin really the BEST investment of 2025",
    "transcript_full": "Bitcoin is at an all-time high and I feel like buying it because clearly everyone else is. So this weekend I sat and did some digging and went through all the basics all over again and I found this answer. But you know we'll actually start with step number one which is first understanding. [Music] About four years ago, Tanme and I were shooting for this one series and over there, Tanme was obsessed with blockchain and trading and crypto. He introduced me to a bunch of experts in Singapore and Dubai. And I started reading these white papers. But the most interesting thing out of all of this was the tech behind it. Blockchain. I'm sure you've heard about it. A centralized verifiable record that's digital cannot be replicated or tarnished. Very different from our central system right now where you have to trust the holders that the data is actually correct. Like if we use a bank which has my savings in it, I have to trust the database of the bank that it doesn't give an error to make sure it remembers what my savings actually is. And think about it. If a database or a ledger is completely public, verifiable, and transparent, you don't have to trust anyone. You just trust the system. And blockchain is the technology everyone was super excited about, which has so many other implications and use cases. But its first most popular use case was the Bitcoin. With Bitcoin, finally, people could actually participate in this kind of tech. So they thought that using Bitcoin they were part of something new and sexy and cool. And I guess this is one of the main reasons why the internet thinks that Bitcoin is a great place to actually invest. So I wrote it down. But I have a second point over here and that's inflation. Right? So I'll write this down. Bitcoin is considered a hedge against inflation. Uh let me explain how this works. It's how the currency is actually designed. There cannot be more than 21 million bitcoins in the world. And there is a process on how those bitcoins come into existence with a process called mining. We won't get into that. But because you cannot print unlimited dollars and rupees like traditional currency, you cannot have rampid crazy inflation because there is scarcity built in the system. So the value has to go up which is why people even call it digital gold. The next reason is actually institutions. My biggest problem with Bitcoin and Ethereum and all these cryptos was that there was no institutional sponsorship. I was so wrong. In 2024, the US government approved the launch of a Bitcoin ETF. And the ETF actually invested in Bitcoin. It's probably worth a few billion dollars, right? Right. It's $140 billion which I think is pretty significant. The biggest player in this entire ETF story is Black Rockck. They manage about 78 billion AUM the last time I checked in just crypto. And actually something really interesting has happened. In March 2025, Superman, sorry, Mr. Trump actually said that national crypto reserve holding coins like Bitcoin and Ethereum will become a thing and they want it to be the crypto capital of the world. But of course, you had Bitcoin, XRP, Cardano, Solana, Ethereum, and all these other cryptos just go through the moon. Now, you're probably thinking that all these are such great things. You should jump to the notion document and then we should figure out how you can start investing. But here's you're a little wrong. you need to first figure out some of the cons as well. So, and before I fill this up, know that the main part is still yet to come, which is how to invest. But before we get there, we obviously have to finish this part. And the first point is it's extremely volatile. The best thing about crypto is that it's global. And the worst thing about it is that it's global. I mean, look at this. Here is a single tweet by Donald Trump in 2019 where he says, \"I'm not a fan of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency.\" And then just now he's talking about creating a reserve. And every time there's an announcement like this, it affects cryptocurrency in a really large way. And of course, we have the famous Elon Musk effect when Elon simply went to his Twitter bio and changed it to this # Bitcoin with the emoji, nothing else. The price of Bitcoin actually went up. Look at this. Do you think something like this could happen to your country's currency? I don't think so. It wouldn't be based off a one announcement, right? Currencies are mostly pretty stable. So, it's a problem. You can't have one individual affect it so much. The entire point of blockchain was power to the people. But if one person has so much power that without doing any transaction on Bitcoin by simply tweeting you can move a currency, that's an issue. And then comes to my favorite part of this don't invest while section and that's scams. [Music] Okay, there is first the FTX story. Over here you can see there was the infamous collapse of FTX in 2022. The CEO Sam Bankman Freed was actually convicted of $8 billion in fraud. A friend of mine had 1 cr rupees cash equivalent in FTX and overnight it went to zero. And then we have stories in India and abroad where actual exchanges had hacks of $200 million, $100 million and this happens all the time. And this is why you should respect India's sebi, India's RBI because you do need oversight when it comes to money enforcement. All these rules of all these players, people will not behave properly if they're not disciplined with actual rules. And the third reason I found was even more interesting and that's actually retail institutional participation. Actually, you know what? I'll just draw an arrow over here because these two points are actually connected because check this out. You see this? That 11% shows that the concentration of large holders is 11% of Bitcoin. Which means that a bunch of really big institutions own and control 11% of all of the available supply of Bitcoin. Now, you can draw your own conclusions from this, but I'd like to show you another number. And this time I want you to actually see it. Tell me in the comments of what's the number for Ethereum. If 11% was Bitcoin, Ethereum is ta 56%. 56% of all of ETH is owned by large holders. And that means retail participation versus institutional participation shouldn't be seen by numbers but by ownership. Which means a bunch of large institutions control that currency. Why this is important you need to understand. Just like supply and demand affects everything, it affects Ethereum and Bitcoin as well. Imagine someone like Satoshi Nakamoto who owns a crazy number of bitcoins. I think last was like $100 billion or something like that, probably more by now. He decided to dump all of it for whatever reason. The price would be affected and open to manipulation um in the short term. This is a problem because you don't want one person to have so much power to move an asset. So that is one risk of volatility because a few institutions can move the market because they own a lot for whatever reason that serves their purpose not your purpose. And here comes my favorite part taxation. So if you look at any asset class, whether it's gold or anything else, maybe stocks, even houses, there is some form of tax benefit when you invest in these uh assets over the long term. Bitcoin has none of this. Bitcoin has a 30% tax on gains, no deductions, no no exemptions, no offset, nothing. 30% flat. There's also 1% TDS that every transaction of a virtual digital asset has above 50,000 rupees. So imagine you take two trades 10,000 rupees in crypto A and 10,000 rupees in crypto B. Now crypto A doubles and goes to 20,000 rupees and it's a nice clean 10,000 rupee profit and you exit and you lock in those gains. But while you were doing this crypto B actually went to zero. So you lost the entire 10,000. So you lose 10,000 made 10,000 net you didn't make any profit. It's a break even scenario. But according to the taxation, you would pay 30% on the gains. So you would still owe 3,000 rupees to the government even though you didn't make anything. Sucks, right? And you know, beyond the taxation, there's also like um legal question mark because it seems like cryptos it at least to me feels like a gray area. There is some legal uncertainty because it's not legal tender and it's not really recognized as much as I'd like to. So there's always some doubt when you're dealing with this. Now let's come down to what you should do. How do you actually invest? It's pretty simple. It's based off of one principle you should really understand well and try to apply to every part of your life. Here is the simple plan. One, make sure you are actually good at work and your skills are great. Yes, I mean work. Your skills are the first asset you're going to invest in which is actually going to make some money. Step number two, make sure you have an emergency fund for 6 months. Number three, make sure you have health and life insurance. Step number four, make sure you have your goals for the next two or three or four or 5 years on what you want from life and invest it in different asset classes like homes, gold, FD, and what stocks or mutual funds if that's easier for you, etc. And you can decide what asset class makes sense for you. Once you've done all of these things and some money is left over, I'm guessing you will use this money to enjoy your life a bit, buy stuff that you want to make those trips is. If there is more money left, then you can allocate it to really highly risky assets such as crypto. Now, I personally will not invest in crypto. Neither will Swati. And I'm totally fine with crypto going 10x from now or even 100x from now. I will not feel bad. It's just not part of my plan. Today from this video, if there's one takeaway, that takeaway is the experiences of your life are way more important than any investment doubling opportunity. So stick to the basics, enjoy life. Hope you enjoyed this video and just forget about it if it was totally based on FOMO. See you in the next episode.",
